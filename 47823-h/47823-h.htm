<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE term Jewellery is used generally in a very
wide sense, and it has been necessary to impose
certain limitations upon its meaning for the
purpose of the present work. Jewellery may be defined
as comprising various objects adapted to personal ornament,
precious in themselves or rendered precious by
their workmanship. The jewel worn as a personal
ornament may be merely decorative, such as the
aigrette or the pendant, or it may be useful as well
as ornamental, such as the brooch or the girdle. Gems
and precious stones are not jewels, in the present sense,
until the jeweller's skill has wrought and set them.
This definition will be found to correspond with the
term <i>minuteria</i> adopted by Italian writers on the goldsmith's
art for objects in precious materials employed for
the adornment of the person, as distinct from <i>grosseria</i>&mdash;those
fashioned for household use or ornament.</p>

<p>With the exception of a chapter dealing with
Egyptian jewellery, I have confined myself solely to
Europe. The work falls into four main divisions. The
first deals with the jewellery worn during classical times,
and until the ninth century of our era. The second
treats of the jewels of the Middle Ages. The third
is devoted to the jewels of the Renaissance, and the
fourth includes those of subsequent times. In the
chapters dealing with Renaissance and later jewellery
I have endeavoured to utilise the valuable evidence,
hitherto generally overlooked or neglected, which may
be derived from the engraved designs and working
drawings of jewellers, from personal inventories, and
from pictures by the old masters. Perhaps too generous
a share of attention has been bestowed on English work;
but this may be pardoned when it is remembered that the
previous literature of jewellery has been almost entirely
from the pens of French and German writers. While
fully appreciating the importance and interest of the
recent revival of artistic jewellery, I have not thought
it necessary, in a book intended mainly for the connoisseur,
to give more than a rapid review of the main
features of the modern movement, with a brief mention
of some prominent craftsmen therein employed. For
similar reasons no general account is given of the
processes of manufacturing articles of jewellery, though
references are made to technical methods when they
serve to explain points of artistic importance.</p>

<p>Assistance has been supplied by numerous works.
The largest debt is due to the learned art historian
Ferdinand Luthmer, whose standard work <i>Gold und
Silber</i> has afforded most important aid. From R&uuml;cklin's
<i>Schmuckbuch</i> I have constantly derived instruction;
and Fontenay's <i>Bijoux anciens et modernes</i> has
been a storehouse of information. Other books which
have been of service are included in the Bibliography.</p>

<p>It is now my duty and pleasure to express my
obligations to all those whose unvarying kindness
has facilitated my researches. Special thanks are
due: to Lady Rothschild, who has presented me with
photographs, specially taken for the purpose, of some
of her choicest jewels; to Lady Fuller-Eliott-Drake,
who at considerable personal inconvenience brought the
Drake jewels to London; to Mr. Jeffery Whitehead,
who despatched for my use a number of jewels from his
collection; to Mr. Max Rosenheim, who, besides placing
at my disposal his unrivalled series of engraved designs
for jewellery, has read through and corrected the portion
of the subject dealing with engraved ornament; to
Sir John Evans, <span class="smcap">k.c.b.</span>, who has guided me personally
through his splendid collections of early jewellery; and
to Dr. Williamson, for assisting me in many ways, and
for the loan, on behalf of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, of
copyright photographs of the finest enamelled miniature-cases
from his catalogue of Mr. Morgan's collection,
with leave to describe and reproduce such of them
as I might select for this volume.</p>

<p>Among those who have favoured me with permission
to publish the treasures in their possession I must
gratefully mention Lady Cook (Viscondessa de Monserrate),
Lady Ramsay, Lady Monckton, Mrs. Holman
Hunt, Mrs. Percy Macquoid, the Marquess of Clanricarde,
Viscount Falkland, and Lord Fitzhardinge;
also Herr James Simon, of Berlin, and Lieut.-Col. G. B.
Croft Lyons, who have presented me with photographs
of their jewels. Thanks are also due to Dr. Kitchin,
Dean of Durham, for the photograph of St. Cuthbert's
Cross; to Dr. Spooner, Warden of New College, for
permission and aid in photographing the New College
jewels; to Dr. J. Anderson, Director of the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, for the loan of
blocks of two jewels in the Edinburgh Museum; to Mr.
F. G. Hilton Price, who enabled me to photograph the
old ledgers in Child's Bank; and to Mr. J. T. Herbert
Baily, for leave to reproduce illustrations to my articles
on the King's gems and jewels at Windsor Castle in
the "Connoisseur" (1902-3). The names of many
others, who have kindly lent me jewels or photographs,
will be found, attached to the individual objects, in the
List of Illustrations.</p>

<p>I would especially thank, amongst others, the following
officers of the Continental museums who have
generously presented me with photographs of articles
of jewellery in the collections under their charge, or
have aided me with their advice:&mdash;Sir Henry Angst,
<span class="smcap">k.c.m.g.</span>, British Consul-General for Switzerland, late
Director of the Zurich Museum; M. E. van Overloop,
Conservator of the Royal Museums, Brussels; Dr.
Lindenschmidt, Director of the Mainz Museum; Dr.
Hermann J. Hermann, Keeper of the Imperial Art Collections,
Vienna; Dr. Wilhelm Behncke, late of the
Kunstgewerbe Museum, Berlin; Dr. H. Graf, Director
of the Bavarian National Museum, Munich; Dr. L.
Curtius, of the Antiquarium, Munich; and M. J. de
Foville, of the Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles, Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale, Paris.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is also due to the officers
of the British Museum for the help they have given me,
particularly to Mr. Cyril Davenport for numerous valuable
suggestions. To my colleagues in the Victoria and
Albert Museum I owe cordial thanks for much encouragement
and help, particularly to Mr. A. Van de Put
for his aid in reading through the proofs of this volume;
and above all to Mr. Martin Hardie, <span class="smcap">a.r.e.</span>, who, besides
executing the pen-drawings which illustrate the text,
has assisted me in various ways, and throughout the
whole course of the present work has favoured me with
constant advice and suggestions.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE love of ornament prompted by vanity is
inherent in the human race. A most primitive
instinct of human beings is to make their
persons more beautiful, more imposing, or more striking
by ornamentation. This inclination is as old as
dress itself, nay, perhaps, dates even further back. For
there are tribes to whom climate and civilisation have
not yet suggested the necessity of clothing the body,
but who nevertheless possess ornaments of some degree
of development. From the rudest of beginnings up
to the last refinements of art, jewelled ornaments have
ever the same purpose in view&mdash;to give prominence
to individual parts of the body by means of glittering,
beautiful objects which involuntarily draw the eye of
the spectator in the desired direction.</p>

<p>Jewellery is not only worn with the purpose of
attracting attention and setting off the beauty of the
person, but satisfies the desire, not less deep-rooted in
humanity, of establishing a distinctive mark of rank
and dignity. In fact the wearing of certain kinds of
ornaments has at times been fixed by legislation.</p>

<p>Among savages, and races not far removed from
barbarism, it may be observed that the love of ornament
is chiefly characteristic of men. As civilisation
advances it is displayed more and more by women alone.
Yet even a century ago, among the most civilised
nations of Europe, the "beaux" and "macaronis"
adorned themselves with jewellery of all kinds. To-day,
however, it is confined, and with greater propriety,
almost entirely to women. Desirous always of pleasing,
the gentle sex has ever sought to add to its charms
by adorning itself with jewels.</p>

<p>Two methods of dealing with the history of the
present subject present themselves. One method consists
in taking individual classes of jewellery, tracing
their complete development, and following the changes
they undergo during the various periods of civilisation.
By the other&mdash;the historical method&mdash;all types of
jewellery in existence at a particular time are examined
side by side within the historical period to which they
belong. The general changes that take place at one
epoch find an echo in every piece of jewellery that
belongs to that epoch. The different classes of jewellery
during every period all bear a distinct relationship
of style. For instance, the changes which take
place in the aspect of the necklace at a particular
epoch will be found to occur at the same time in that
of the bracelet and girdle. But there may exist the
widest divergence in style and idea between a particular
piece of jewellery and its successor of a
subsequent period. For these reasons an historical
and chronological mode of treatment has been adopted,
which will allow more completeness of observation,
and fuller and more scientific investigation of style
and craftmanship. Certain difficulties are nevertheless
encountered, because periods and fashions naturally
overlap. This is particularly the case in times when
communication was not easy; since some people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xxxix" id="page_xxxix">{xxxix}</a></span>
would cling to an old form of jewellery, while others,
more travelled or more fashionably minded, would
prefer a new.</p>

<p>In proceeding towards a systematic classification of
personal ornaments it may be advisable, instead of
dealing with the separate ornaments of each period
according to their relative importance or prominence,
to follow a simpler and more natural plan. Thus, the
ornaments dealt with in each succeeding epoch will
in every case be those worn: (1) on the head&mdash;diadems,
tiaras, aigrettes, hair-pins, jewels for the hat and cap,
and earrings; (2) on the neck&mdash;necklaces and neck-chains
hung with numerous varieties of pendants; (3)
on the breast&mdash;brooches, clasps, buttons; (4) on the
limbs&mdash;armlets, anklets, bracelets, rings; and (5) on
the body and waist&mdash;girdles and their various attachments,
chatelaines, and miscellaneous pendent ornaments,
such as pomanders, scent-cases, rosaries, etc.</p>

<p>A few preliminary words may be said respecting the
evolution of some of the various ornaments employed
on the different parts of the body.</p>

<p>The custom of decorating the head with jewelled
ornaments was probably suggested by the natural idea
of encircling it with flowers in token of joy or triumph.
The use of diadems was in early times generally
reserved for those of noble birth. From the fillets
employed for binding the hair, developed circlets, which
with the addition of precious stones assumed the dignity
of crowns.</p>

<p>The use of earrings as personal ornaments seems
to have originated in the East, where they have always
been in favour. Earrings formed an important article
of jewellery during the classical ages, but they were not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xl" id="page_xl">{xl}</a></span>
commonly worn again in Europe until the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. At the present moment
fashion does not decree their general use.</p>

<p>The necklace&mdash;one of the most primitive of ornaments&mdash;is
worn either close round the throat, loosely
round the neck, or low down upon the breast. Occasionally,
as among savage peoples, it takes the form of
a ring; but as a rule it is formed either of a simple cord,
or a chain formed by the appropriate linking together
of rings, perforated discs, or pierced balls. Artistic
effects are produced by a regular alternation of these
details, as well as by the tapering of the chain from the
middle towards the ends. Neck-chains with symbolic
elements are those worn as orders and as signs
of dignity.</p>

<p>The necklace may be further ornamented by a row
of pendants, or more generally a single pendent ornament.
The pendant thus employed has become, perhaps,
the most beautiful of all articles of adornment.
It occupies a conspicuous position upon the person, and
possibly for this reason has evoked the greatest skill
and refinement of the jeweller's art. Its varieties are
manifold&mdash;from the primitive charm, and the symbolic
ornaments of the Middle Ages, to the elaborate pendant,
for the most part purely decorative, dating from
Renaissance times.</p>

<p>Next comes the important group of ornaments worn
chiefly on the breast, comprising brooches, clasps and
pins, employed for fastening the dress. All have their
origin in the simple pin. To this class belongs the
hair-pin, of which the most handsome and varied
examples are to be found in ancient work. Unlike
modern hair-pins which are provided with two points,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xli" id="page_xli">{xli}</a></span>
they have a single cylindrical or slightly conical stem,
pointed at one end, and terminated at the other with a
knob or some other finial.</p>

<p>A simple pin for the dress was uncommon in antiquity,
and its general use for this purpose belongs to
comparatively recent times. Its place was always
taken, especially in early periods, by a brooch&mdash;an
outcome of the pin&mdash;which supplied the want of buttons.
The brooch, an ornament of very considerable importance,
can be traced down from the earliest civilisation,
and is a valuable criterion in questions of ethnic movements.
The story, however, of the growth of each of
the different classes into which primitive brooches may
be divided, the periods at which these ornaments made
their appearance, and the deductions of ethnographical
interest that may be drawn therefrom, must of necessity
lie outside the scope of the present work.</p>

<span class="caption1">Safety pin.</span>
</div>

<p>All brooches, as has been said, originated from the
simple pin, which itself was preceded by and probably
derived from a thorn. At an early period this pin,
after having been passed through the garment, was for
greater security bent up, and its point caught behind
the head. Later, in order that the point might be held
more securely in the catch, the pin was given a complete
turn, which produced the spring, as seen in the
common form of our modern safety-pin. Thus constructed,
the brooch, though
in one piece, may be said
to consist of four parts;
(<i>a</i>) the acus or pin; (<i>b</i>) the
spring or hinge; (<i>c</i>) the
catch or locking apparatus,
which forms the sheath of the pin; and (<i>d</i>) the bow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xlii" id="page_xlii">{xlii}</a></span>

or back&mdash;the framework uniting the spring with the
catch.</p>

<span class="caption1">Romano-British

</div>

<p>From this primitive safety-pin, which is the foundation
form of all brooches with a catch, developed the
numerous varieties and patterns of the brooch or fibula
of succeeding ages. Amongst these is the Roman
fibula, which instead of being made of one piece of
metal, is of two pieces&mdash;the bow and the acus. The
pin here works on a hinge&mdash;the result
of gradually extending the coils of the
spring symmetrically on each side of the
pin into what is known as the double-twisted
or bilateral spring, and placing a
bar through the coils thus made. From
the brooch hinged in this manner originated
the Roman provincial fibula of the
<b>T</b>-shaped type common in France and
Britain, and later the cruciform brooch
of Anglo-Saxon times. The brooch with
with a hinge was exclusively used until the
revival of the "safety pin" with a
spring, patented as a new invention in the nineteenth
century.</p>

<span class="caption1">Brooch formed of double spiral discs of
concentric wire ("Spectacle" fibula.)</span>
</div>

<p>In addition to the above brooches or fibul&aelig; (group
1)&mdash;all developments of the safety-pin type&mdash;there
are three other large groups of
brooches: (2) the circular disc
type; (3) the penannular or Celtic
brooch; and (4) the ring-brooch.
The first of these&mdash;the type generally
worn at the present day&mdash;may
be described as a flat disc fitted with a hinged
pin. In cemeteries belonging to the Early Iron Age
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xliii" id="page_xliii">{xliii}</a></span>
in Southern Europe circular plates have been found
fitted with a pin. These plates
appear<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
to have been
developed by the conversion of a primitive disc of
spiral concentric wire into a circular plate. From the
brooch of this type sprang the circular brooch of the
Roman period, often inlaid with enamel, as well as the
splendid circular brooches of Anglo-Saxon times, and
all other disc-shaped brooches. In all early periods,
and even in Roman times, the bow or
safety-pin type of brooch was commoner
than the disc and also more practical,
as it offered room for the gathered folds
of the garment. In modern times the
disc-shaped brooch fitted with a hinged
or sometimes with a spring pin has
been principally used.</p>

</div>

<p>The two remaining groups of
brooches&mdash;(3) the Celtic brooch and
(4) the ring-brooch&mdash;are both developments
of the simple pin in combination
with a ring&mdash;in the former case penannular and in
the latter annular. The Celtic brooch, with penannular
ring and long pin, is apparently
the result of fitting a
pin to a prehistoric form of
fastening for the dress&mdash;a penannular
ring terminating with
knobs, known as a mammillary
fibula. The ring-brooch with
complete ring, and pin of the
same length as the diameter of
the ring, which was popular in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xliv" id="page_xliv">{xliv}</a></span>
medi&aelig;val times, is the outcome of fitting a complete
ring of wire to a pin to prevent the head of the pin
from slipping through the material&mdash;which ring in course
of time became the more important member. It is
improbable that the Celtic brooch originated in the
same way, from the union of a long pin with a small
ring. Nor is it likely that these two forms of brooches
were evolved the one out of the other by the shortening
or lengthening of the pins. As a matter of fact
the two appear to have arisen independently side by
side.</p>

<p>Bracelets and armlets may be considered together,
for though the bracelet is properly only a decoration
for the wrist, the term has become descriptive of any
ornament worn upon the arm. The bracelet, together
with the necklace, were the earliest ornaments used for
the decoration of mankind. Amongst savage tribes
both were worn in some form or another&mdash;the necklace
as an ornament pure and simple, but the bracelet
serving frequently a practical purpose, sometimes as a
shield for the arm in combat, sometimes covered with
spikes, and used for offensive purposes. While used
universally by women in the form of a band, closed,
or open on one side, or else in the shape of a spiral,
or fashioned like a chain, the bracelet has been worn
from the earliest times in the East by men also, especially
by princes as one of the insignia of royalty, and
by distinguished persons in general.</p>

<p>Of all jewels the simplest and at the same time
perhaps the most interesting and important is the
finger ring. It is universally employed as an article
of personal ornament, and has been worn by both
sexes at almost all times, and in nearly every country.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xlv" id="page_xlv">{xlv}</a></span>
Sometimes it is an object of use as the signet ring,
or a token of dignity as the bishop's ring. Sometimes
it has a symbolical significance, as the wedding-ring.
Sometimes it is purely ornamental. Most finger
rings may be said to be formed of two parts&mdash;the
circular portion which surrounds the finger, known as
the hoop or shank, and the enlarged or upper portion
which is called the bezel. This latter term, applied to
the upper side of the ring, which is broadened to
receive an ornament of some kind, generally a stone,
seems to have originally designated the basil or projecting
flange, that retained the stone in its setting.
The term <i>collet</i>, also used for the whole top including
the stone or seal, is similarly derived from the
flange or collet in which the stone is set. From its
box-like shape this part of the ring is also called the
<i>chaton</i>.</p>

<span class="caption1">Buckle, with buckle-plate and
tag. German, about 1490. (Victoria and Albert Museum.)</span>
</div>

<p>The belt or girdle was worn round the waist by
men as a means of suspending weapons, by women
sometimes merely as an ornament, and generally by
both sexes for the practical purpose of confining the
clothing. It is commonly formed of a band of leather
or textile material. The part as a rule which receives
particular attention is the fastening. This is either
in the form of a clasp, or more often a buckle. The
clasp consists of two parts, generally symmetrical, one
of which can be hooked into the other. The buckle,
another combination of a ring with a pin, is similar
to the medi&aelig;val ring-brooch, but differs from it in that
while the pin of the brooch pierces the material twice,
that of the buckle pierces it only once. It may be
described as a rectangular or curved rim having one or
more hinged pins or spikes attached on one side of it or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xlvi" id="page_xlvi">{xlvi}</a></span>
on a bar across its centre, and long enough to rest upon
the opposite side. The buckle is made fast to one end
of the girdle; whilst the other end, drawn through on
the principle of a slip knot, is kept
fast by pushing the point of the pin
or tongue through a hole made in
the material of the girdle. The girdle
is attached by means of sewing a fold
of it round the bar or round one side
of the rim of the buckle. As a great
strain was put upon the doubling of
the leather or stuff, this soonest gave
way. Consequently a plate of metal
was passed round the bar or edge of
the buckle, and the two portions of it
received the end of the strap between
them. The whole was then made
fast with rivets. The plate is known
as the buckle-plate. One end of the
girdle being thus furnished, the other
was frequently made to terminate with
a metal chape to enable it to pass easily through the
ring of the buckle in the process of buckling and unbuckling.
This chape is known also as the <i>mordant</i>.
The chief point of the girdle to be decorated was the
buckle-plate, which was often in one piece with the
buckle, or hinged to it. The <i>mordant</i> or tag was
commonly decorated too, while ornaments of metal of
similar design, sometimes jewelled, were applied at
regular intervals to the strap or band of the girdle.
In later years the girdle often took the form of a chain,
on which, as in the case of chains for the neck and
wrists, artistic effects were produced by a regular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_xlvii" id="page_xlvii">{xlvii}</a></span>

sequence of links. Fastened by a clasp, it was worn by
women chiefly as an ornament, or to carry small objects
for personal use. For the latter purpose it was subsequently
supplanted by the chatelaine.</p>

<h2>EARLY JEWELLERY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="center"><b>EGYPTIAN AND PH&OElig;NICIAN JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">M</span>OST of the forms met with among the
jewellery of the civilised nations of later
times are found represented in the ornaments
of the Egyptians. It is fortunate that important
specimens of all descriptions of these have come down
to our days. This we owe to the elaborate care which
the Egyptians bestowed on the preservation of the
dead, and to the strict observance of funeral rites,
which induced them to dress and ornament their
mummies with a view to future comfort both in the
grave and in the after life. The ornaments, however,
buried with the dead were frequently mere models of
what were worn in life, and the pains taken in making
these depended on the sums expended by the friends of
the deceased after his death. While those who were
possessed of means and were scrupulous in their last
duties to the dead purchased ornaments of the best
workmanship and of the most costly materials, others
who were unable or unwilling to incur expense in
providing such objects were contented with glass
pastes instead of precious stones, and glazed pottery instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span>
of gold. With the exception of many finger rings
worn by both sexes and some female ornaments, the
greater number of jewels discovered in the tombs
are of inferior quality and value to those which the
deceased had worn when living.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the jewellery of the Egyptians is
that, in addition to its actual purpose, it generally
possesses something of the allegorical and emblematic
signification, for which their mythology offered plentiful
material. Among the emblems or figures of objects
which symbolise or suggest the qualities of deities, the
most favourite is the <i>scarab</i> or beetle, type of the god
<i>Khepera</i>. The use of scarabs in burial had reference
to the resurrection of the dead and immortality. Other
important emblems include the <i>uza</i> or <i>utchat</i>, the
symbolic eye&mdash;the eye of <i>Horus</i>, the hawk-god;
the cobra snake, the <i>ur&aelig;us</i>&mdash;emblem of divine and
royal sovereignty; the <i>tet</i>, the four-barred emblem of
stability, endurance, and lastingness; the human-headed
hawk, emblem of the soul. These and many others,
as well as figures from the animal world, were worn
as ornaments, and especially as amulets to bring good
fortune or to ward off evil.</p>

<p>Colour plays an important part in Egyptian jewellery.
This love of colour was displayed in the use of glazed
ware, incorrectly termed porcelain, but properly a faience,
much employed for all articles, as necklaces, scarabs,
and rings, and particularly for the various kinds of
amulets which were largely worn as personal ornaments.
The most usual and beautiful was the cupreous glaze
of a blue or apple-green colour; yellow, violet, red, and
white are also met with, but less frequently, and chiefly
at later periods. But colour showed itself above all in
the surface decoration of jewellery, produced by the
application of coloured stones and the imitation of
these inserted in cells of gold prepared for them. The
chief materials employed for the purpose were lapis-lazuli,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span>
turquoise, root of emerald or green felspar,
jasper, and obsidian, besides various opaque glasses
imitating them.</p>

<p>With the exception of enamel upon metal, which is
only found in Egypt in quite late periods, the Egyptians
appear to have been acquainted with all the
processes of jewellery now in use. Chasing and
engraving they preferred to all other modes of ornamenting
metal-work, as these methods enhanced the
beauty of their jewels while retaining a level surface.
They were also highly skilled in soldering and in the
art of repouss&eacute; work. The great malleability of gold
enabled them to overlay ornaments of silver, bronze, and
even stone with thin leaves of this metal; while ornaments
were also composed entirely of plates of gold of
extreme thinness. In articles where frequent repetition
occurs, for instance, in necklaces, patterns were
produced by pressure in moulds, and then soldered
together.</p>

<p>Examples of jewellery furnished by the Egyptian
tombs are to be found in the museums of almost every
country. Undoubtedly the finest collection is in the
Viceregal Museum of Egyptian Antiquities at Cairo.
It contains jewels of the earliest dynasties, very few of
which are to be found outside it. Dating from the
great Theban dynasties, the eighteenth and nineteenth,
when the jeweller's art reached its highest level, are
many beautiful examples, notably the famous set of
jewels discovered in the tomb of Queen
Ȧāh-Ḥetep (1600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>). Fine collections are also preserved in the
British Museum, in Berlin, Munich, and in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Following the sequence of ornaments from the
head downwards, mention must first be made of
diadems or frontlets. These were composed either of
ring ornaments, set with precious stones and strung in
a variety of ways, which hung down over the temples,
or of gold bands ornamented in cloisonn&eacute; inlay with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>
the favourite allegorical representations of animals in
various arrangements. In the case of royal personages
there is a ur&aelig;us in front.</p>

<p>Among all Oriental nations of antiquity of whom
we have any accurate knowledge, earrings have
always been in general use by both sexes; but as
far as can be judged from monuments, these ornaments
appear in Egypt to have been worn by women alone.
M. Fontenay<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> claims that the holes visible in the ears
of statues of Rameses II&mdash;such as the colossal head in
the British Museum, cast from the original in the
temple of Ipsamboul&mdash;have been pierced for earrings.
But even so, earrings had probably only a sacerdotal
or sacred significance, and were worn by the sovereign
only, and on very exceptional occasions. Earrings,
however, found very little favour even among women
until what in Egyptian chronology are comparatively
late times. Those that do occur are of the simplest
kind, formed of a ring-shaped hook for piercing the
lobe of the ear, hung with a blossom-shaped or symbolical
pendant. Large penannular rings of various
materials were occasionally employed as ear ornaments;
the opening in them enabling them to be fitted on to
the upper part of the ear.</p>

<p>Necklaces appear to have played a very prominent
part in Egyptian ornaments. No tomb seems to be
without them, and the wall paintings also prove their
very general use. Most frequent is a chain consisting
of various materials strung together, generally with
a large drop or figure in the centre, and pendent
motives introduced at definite intervals. The latter, of
every imaginable variety of design, occur in rhythmical
alternation, and are occasionally introduced between
two rows of beads. The peculiarly severe and regular
decorations of the Egyptians&mdash;more particularly the
various charming adaptations of open and closed lotus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span>
flowers&mdash;are here found in the finest forms of application.
Especially is this shown on the ornament called
the <i>usekh</i> collar, which figures on every mummy and
mummy case. Formed of rows, generally of cylinder-shaped
beads with pendants, strung together and
gathered up at either end to the head of a lion or hawk
or to a lotus flower, this collar or breast decoration
covered the shoulders and chest, and is found in that
position on the mummy, attached frequently to the
winding-sheet.</p>

<p>One of the most important Egyptian ornaments is
the <i>pectoral</i>, which, as its name implies, was worn on
the breast, suspended by a ribbon or chain. In all
probability it formed a portion of the everyday costume
of men and women, but its symbolism points to its
chief use as a mortuary ornament, and it is found on
almost every mummy. Pectorals are usually in the
form of a <i>pylon</i> or shrine, in the middle of which
is often a scarab, the emblem of transformation
and immortality, adored by the goddesses <i>Isis</i> or
<i>Nephthys</i>.</p>

<p>These ornaments were made of metal&mdash;rarely gold,
more often gilded bronze&mdash;and very frequently of
alabaster, steatite, and basalt sometimes glazed, and
of earthenware always glazed. In the Cairo Museum
is a pectoral of pure gold inlaid with carnelian, lapis-lazuli
and turquoises, which was found at Dash&ucirc;r in
1894 in the tomb of the Princess Set-Hathor (twelfth
dynasty). Discovered at the same time was a pectoral
having at the top a vulture with outspread wings and
below the name of Usertsen III supported on either
side by hawk-headed sphinxes. The open-work pectoral
of Queen Ȧāh-Ḥetep, of solid gold, also at Cairo, is one
of the most beautiful of all specimens of Egyptian
jewellery. Another golden pectoral, found in the tomb
of Kh&#x101;-em-uas, son of Rameses II, is in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar to the pectorals are jewels in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>
the shape of conventional hawks. As emblems of the
soul, they are found placed upon the breast of the
mummy. The finest are made of pure gold decorated
with cloisons shaped according to the natural formations
of the body and wings of the bird. The talons
grasp a pair of signet rings. Allied to these are
ornaments known as <i>&aelig;gides</i>, which were occasionally
also worn on the breast. A very beautiful specimen,
the <i>&aelig;gis of Bast</i>, is in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Sculptures and paintings represent bracelets by
bands of red or blue colour on the arms, and show
that the Egyptians wore four&mdash;one on the wrist and
one above the elbow of each arm. Some of the earliest
are composed of glass and gold beads threaded so as to
form various patterns. The more solid forms of bracelet
are ornamented with inlaid work. Rings for the arms,
as well as the ankles, are generally of plain gold&mdash;both
solid and hollow&mdash;sometimes bordered with plaited
chain-work. Bracelets of thick and occasionally twisted
wire, found as early as the twelfth dynasty, usually
have the ends beaten out into a thin wire, which is
lapped round the opposite shank so as to slip easily
over the wrist. Bracelets in the form of serpents
belong to the Ptolemaic and early Roman periods.</p>

<p>The commonest ornament is the finger ring. The
ring was not only an ornament, but an actual necessity,
since it served as a signet, the owner's emblem or badge
being engraved either on the metal of the ring or on a
scarab or other stone set in it. There are three main
types of Egyptian rings. The first and simplest, composed
of a seal stone with a ring attached, is formed of
a hoop with flattened ends, each pierced, which grasp
the scarab. Through a hole made in the scarab was
run a wire, the ends of which, passing through the
extremities of the ring, were wound several times round
it. The revolving scarab exhibited its back when worn
on the finger and the engraved side when necessary to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>
use it as a seal. The general outline of the ring is like
a stirrup, a form which of course varied in accordance
with the size of the scarab. In a second type of
ring the swivel disappears, and the ring is in one piece.
Its outline retains the stirrup form, but the inside of the
hoop is round and fits closely to the finger. Of this type
are rings, dating from the eighteenth to the twentieth
dynasty, formed of two hoops united at the top and
having the names and titles of the owner deeply sunk
in hieroglyphics on oblong gold bezels. A third type,
almost circular in outline, is of similar form to the
signet-ring of the present day. In addition to those
which were actually worn in life, are models of real
rings employed solely for funeral purposes to ornament
the fingers of the wooden model hands which were
placed on the coffins of mummies of the eighteenth and
nineteenth dynasties. The model rings are made of
faience with fine glazes of blue, green, and other colours,
with various devices, incuse or in intaglio, upon the
bezels, which are generally of oval form.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>PH&OElig;NICIAN JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p>As the inventors of methods and the creators of
models which exercised a widespread influence in the
development of subsequent types of ornaments, Egypt,
and in a lesser degree Assyria also, occupies a position
of considerable importance. The chief agents in the
spreading of these methods and models were the
Ph&oelig;nicians, the first and foremost navigators of the
ancient world, who imported jewels among other
articles of trade, into Italy and into the islands and mainland
of Greece. Not by nature creative, but always
copying those nations with whom in their wanderings
they came in touch, the Ph&oelig;nicians produced a native
jewellery of composite type in which there is a perpetual
mixture of Egyptian and Assyrian forms. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>
they had imitated Egypt and Assyria, so they began to
imitate Greece as soon as they came into contact with
her. The Greeks in return made great use at first of
this composite style, but subsequently shook off its
influence and incorporated it only after many modifications
into their own developed art. The amphora&mdash;a
form of ornament in goldsmith's work which can be
traced to Assyria&mdash;is one among many motives borrowed
by the Ph&oelig;nicians, and transmitted by them to
Greece.</p>

<p>From Egypt the Ph&oelig;nicians acquired a high degree
of technical skill and mastery over materials. This
finish was transmitted to the finest Greek jewellery,
and to the personal ornaments of the early Etruscans.
The art of soldering gold to gold, which was known
in Egypt at an early period, was greatly perfected and
developed by the Ph&oelig;nicians; and it is generally
believed that they were the inventors of the process of
decorating jewellery by granulation, that is by affixing
to the surface minute globules of gold&mdash;a process which
attained its perfection in the skilful hands of the
Etruscan goldsmiths.</p>

<p>The jewellery of the Ph&oelig;nicians must be sought
for from one end of the Mediterranean to the other,
rather than in Ph&oelig;nicia itself. It occurs chiefly in their
settlements on the shores and islands of the Eastern
Mediterranean, at Sardinia, Crete, and Rhodes, and on
the southern coasts of Asia Minor, but the best and
most numerous specimens have been found in Cyprus.</p>

<p>In addition to the actual ornaments, special value
attaches also to Ph&oelig;nician sculptures, principally
busts, both from Ph&oelig;nicia itself and from its colonies,
owing to the care with which personal ornaments and
details of dress are represented. Several striking
examples of these are preserved in the galleries set
apart for Cyprian and Ph&oelig;nician antiquities in the
British Museum. The most famous of similar works,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span>
which include the sculptures from the "Cerro de los
Santos," near Yecla in the province of Albacete in Spain,
now in the museum at Madrid, is the remarkable stone
bust of a woman in the Louvre, known as the "Lady
of Elch&eacute;," from a town of that name in the province of
Alicante, where it was discovered in 1897 (<a href="#PLATE_II">Pl. II, 9</a>). The
majestic character of this figure, its sumptuous coiffure
with clusters of tassels suspended by ten chains, the
wheel-like discs cover the ears, the triple row of
necklaces with their urn-shaped pendants&mdash;all unite to
produce an effect unequalled by any known statue of
antiquity. Especially noticeable among these ornaments
is the diadem which encircles the forehead and
hangs down from each side in long pendants upon the
shoulders. With this may be compared the chains
hung at the ends of the golden fillet at Berlin, discovered
by Schliemann at the pre-Mycen&aelig;an city of
Hissarlik in the Troad, the ornate tasselled appendages
at St. Petersburg, found with the famous Greek
diadems in the tombs of the Crimea, and the elaborate
head ornaments with pendent ends worn by Algerian
women at the present day.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians, as seen also by their sculptures,
were addicted to the barbaric practice of piercing the
upper parts of the ears, as well as the lobes, and attaching
to them rings bearing drop-shaped pendants.
Rings were also attached to the hair on each side of the
face. They consist of a double twist which could be
run through a curl of the hair, and are ornamented at
one end with a lion's or gryphon's head.</p>

<p>Of ordinary earrings worn by the Ph&oelig;nicians the
simplest is a plain ring. In the majority of cases the
simple ring was converted into a hook and served
to suspend various ornaments, of which baskets or
bushels with grain in them afforded favourite motives.
Examples of earrings of this kind, from Tharros in
Sardinia, are in the British Museum.</p>

Statues, like the Lady of Elch&eacute;, show that Ph&oelig;nician
women wore three or four necklaces at the same
time, one above the other; these vary in the size of
their elements, from the small beads about the throat,
to the large acorn-shaped pendants which hang low
upon the breast. They display a striking admixture
of Greek and Egyptian motives. Gold beads are often
intermixed with small carnelian and onyx bugles, to
which hang amphor&aelig; formed alternately of gold or
crystal. The Ph&oelig;nicians were particularly skilled in
the manufacture of glass: occasionally the sole materials
of their necklaces are beads of glass. A necklace from
Tharros in Sardinia, now in the British Museum, is
formed of beads of glass and gold; of its three
pendants, the centre one is the head of a woman with
Egyptian coiffure, and the two others lotus flowers.</p>

<p>Finger rings are of all materials&mdash;gold, silver,
bronze, and even glass. They are usually set with
a scarab or scaraboid, fixed or revolving on a pivot.
Silver is less common than gold; but in the British
Museum is a ring of almost pure Greek workmanship
from Cyprus which is entirely of silver, save for an
exquisitely modelled golden fly that rests on the bezel.</p>

<p class="center"><b>GREEK JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">B</span>EFORE dealing with Greek jewellery of the
classic period some reference must be made to
the primitive and archaic ornaments that preceded
it. The period and phase of Greek culture to
which the primitive ornaments belong is known widely
as "Mycen&aelig;an"&mdash;a title it owes to the discoveries
made at Mycen&aelig;, where in 1876 Schliemann brought
to light the famous gold treasure now preserved in the
National Museum at Athens. A characteristic motive
of the decoration of these objects is the use of spiral
patterns almost identical with those employed on
Celtic ornaments. Besides these and other primitive
exhibitions of decorative skill, we find representations
of naturalistic animal forms, such as cuttlefish, starfish,
butterflies, and other creatures. These are displayed
in repouss&eacute; patterns worked in low relief. Among the
most notable objects are a number of gold crowns
usually in the form of elongated oval plates ornamented
with fine work chiefly in the shape of rosettes and
spirals.</p>

<p>Most numerous are the gold plates intended to be
fastened to the dress. They are ornamented with
spirals and radiating lines, with the above-mentioned
animal forms, or with leaves showing the veins clearly
marked (<a href="#PLATE_III">Pl. III, 1</a>). Specially worthy of note also are
the finger rings with the designs sunk into the oval
surface of the bezel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span>
Ornaments of this same epoch, like those in the
British Museum from Ialysos in Rhodes, and Enkomi
in Cyprus, have been discovered throughout the whole
&AElig;gean district. They are likewise mainly in the form
of gold plates used for sepulchral purposes, ornamented
with embossed patterns impressed from stone moulds.
Some of them are enriched with fine granulation.
This particular process, however, which abounds
in Etruscan work, is more frequent on Greek ornaments
of the archaic epoch, which dates roughly
from about the seventh or eighth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
The types of these, generally semi-Oriental in character,
show the influence of Ph&oelig;nician art, with its traces of
Egyptian and Assyrian feeling. Lions and winged
bulls on some objects betray the Assyrian style; the
treatment of the human figure displays on others the
influence of Egypt. Among the best examples of this
Gr&aelig;co-Ph&oelig;nician jewellery are those found at Kameiros
in Rhodes, and now in the Louvre and the British
Museum. Between these and the fourth-century jewels
from the Crimea to be described next, the only
known Greek jewels are the quasi-Oriental ones from
the tombs of Cyprus, which belong to about the fifth
century.</p>

<p>The jewellery of ancient Greece, which requires
more detailed consideration, is that worn from the close
of the fifth century onwards. The jewellery of the
Greeks at this epoch was, like all their other works
of art, of surpassing excellence. Gold was wrought
with a skill which showed how well the artist appreciated
the beauty of its colour and its distinctive
qualities of ductility and malleability. The Greek
craftsman was ever careful to keep the material in strict
subordination to the workmanship, and not to allow its
intrinsic worth so to dominate his productions as to
obscure his artistic intention. The Greek goldsmiths
excelled in the processes of repouss&eacute;, chasing, engraving,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span>
and of intaglio cutting on metal, and brought to
great perfection the art of soldering small objects on to
thin surfaces and joining together the thinnest metal
plates.</p>

<p>Granulated work, in which they were rivalled by
the Etruscans alone, the Greeks practised with success,
but preferred filigree ornamentation, that is the use of
fine threads of gold twisted upon the surface with
very delicate effect. Precious stones were very rarely
used in the finest work, though on many of the
post-Alexandrine jewels, stones such as garnets
were frequently employed. Colour was obtained
by a sparing use of enamel. The value of Greek
jewellery lies in the use of gold and the artistic
development of this single material. The minuteness
of jewellery did not lead the Greeks to despise
it as a field of labour. Whatever designs they
borrowed from others the Greeks made their own and
reproduced in a form peculiar to themselves. In
other respects they went straight to nature, choosing
simple motives of fruit, flowers, and foliage, united
with a careful imitation of animal forms and of the
human body.</p>

<p>The objects we have to consider fall into two classes,
according as they are either substantial articles for use
or ornament in daily life, or mere flimsy imitations of
them made only to be buried with the dead. As in the
case of other nations of antiquity, the demands of
Greek piety were satisfied if the dead were adorned
with jewels made cheaply of leaves of stamped or
bracteate gold. This course was followed mainly for
the purpose of lessening expense; but it served also
to obviate the chance of tombs being rifled by tomb-robbers
or <i>tymborychoi</i>, who practised a profession
which was common in ancient times and offered large
and certain profits.</p>

<p>Jewels simply and entirely funereal occupy a prominent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span>
position in every public and private collection of
Greek jewellery. The rarity of jewels for actual use
may be further explained by the fact that articles of
that kind would only be associated with the grave
of a person of wealth and distinction, and that the
more important graves were the first prey of robbers.</p>

<p>The almost complete absence of specimens of
jewellery from the mainland of Greece is due to those
acts of pillage which continually took place at localities
well known as cemeteries. Only in tombs concealed
by their environment, or lost to sight in semi-barbarous
countries, have sufficient ornaments been found for us
to form an estimate of the perfection which this branch
of the industrial arts then attained. The chief sources
of these discoveries have been the Crimea, the Greek
islands, the west coast of Asia Minor, and Southern
Italy&mdash;known in ancient times as Magna Gr&aelig;cia. Of
these districts by far the most important was that on
the northern shore of the Black Sea, called formerly
the Tauric Chersonese and now the Crimea, where in
close proximity to the warlike Scythian tribes a Greek
colony had settled as early as the sixth century before
our era. Excavations made also in the adjacent
peninsula of Taman have revealed numerous articles of
gold, all belonging to the latter half of the
century. The wealth of gold on the shores of the
Black Sea, which is the basis of the early Greek legends
of the Golden Fleece, had attracted merchant adventurers
at an early date. And the Greek goldsmiths
who settled there forwarded their productions both to
their mother-country and to the neighbouring lands
of the barbarians. Excavations undertaken by the
Russian Government near Kertch, the ancient Pantikapaion,
gave rise to an important discovery in 1831,
when the opening of the celebrated tumulus Koul-Oba
revealed a magnificent display of Greek jewellery.
These treasures, and others which the enterprise of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span>
the Russian Government has brought to light, are
preserved at St. Petersburg in the Museum of the
Hermitage.</p>

<p>Italy, less systematically ravaged than Greece, has
proved exceedingly rich in finds of antique jewellery.
Except for a few scattered fragments from Greece
proper and the other sources mentioned above, public
and private cabinets, outside Russia, are made up
almost exclusively of the results of excavations in the
burial-places of Magna Gr&aelig;cia.</p>

<p>In no ornament did the Greek jeweller exhibit his
fertility of invention to a greater degree than in the
variety and beauty of the forms given to earrings.
They divide naturally into two classes. The first, the
earlier, are ring-shaped, of two halves formed in a
mould and united together. They terminate at one end
with a human head&mdash;like that of a M&aelig;nad in a specimen
in the British Museum&mdash;or more usually with the head of
a lion, bull, or some other animal. To the second class
belong those attached to the ear by a hook masked by
a rosette or disc. From this hang one or more
pendants of a variety of designs. In rare instances
these consist of beads hung to little chains; but the
logical sense of the ancients preferred for the purpose
things that might be imagined as floating, such as
a little figure of Eros, or a tiny Victory bearing
a wreath. The place on the ring where the pendant
is attached is almost invariably made prominent by
a saucer-shaped rosette, a mask, or similar object
ornamented with fine threads of gold. Opaque enamel,
of white, blue, or green, is sometimes found applied
thinly to the surface of the metal. Many earrings are
of the most complicated design. When the ear-pendant
was confined to a ring with a crescent-shaped lower part,
this ornament would produce no effect except when the
wearer was seen in profile. In order to make the
ornament visible from the front, the idea suggested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span>
itself to hang the crescent ring on to a smaller one.
Wonderfully well executed are some of the later Greek
earrings in which small figures are attached directly to
the hook which is inserted into the ear. Among these
are figures of Eros playing a musical instrument or
holding a jug as if pouring a libation.</p>

<p>By the amplification of the appendages we find the
simpler earrings assume such an immense increase in
dimension as to make it impossible that they were
attached to the lobe of the ear. It may be assumed
that they were fastened to the diadem or frontlet, or to
a plaited tress of hair, and hung over the ear, or more
to the front over the temples. Naturally this species
of ornament, owing to its weight and the many separate
pieces of which it was made, would prevent the wearer
from making any rapid movements, but was adapted to
a slow and dignified pace in walking. It would also
have the additional motive of increasing the commanding
appearance of the individual. A splendid pair of
head appendages of this character discovered at Kertch
are now at St. Petersburg. They are composed of two
large medallions representing the head of Athene, whose
helmet is adorned with sphinxes and gryphons. From
these are suspended several rows of amphora-shaped
ornaments covered with fine filigree decoration.</p>

<p>The decorating of the head with wreaths was a
very common practice among the ancients on festive
occasions of every description. The wreaths with
which the dead were adorned for burial, made in
imitation of natural leaves, form a large portion of
funereal jewellery. One of the most famous of this
species, found in 1813 at Armento (S. Italy), and
purchased about 1826 by Ludwig I, King of Bavaria,
from Countess Lipona (formerly Queen of Naples and
wife of Joachim Murat) is now in the Antiquarium at
Munich. Here the wreath, formed of roses, narcissus,
myrtle and oak leaves, is enlivened by small figures of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span>
genii, while on the top is placed a statue with an
inscription underneath it. This splendid specimen
was probably employed for votive purposes. Dating
from the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and also from Magna
Gr&aelig;cia, is the gold crown in the British Museum
which was acquired from the collection of Count
Tyszkiewicz in 1898 (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl. V, 1</a>). Being of more solid
construction, though excessively light and elegant,
this, and similarly elaborate crowns in the Louvre,
were probably worn by ladies of high rank.</p>

<span class="caption2">(earrings, necklace and hair-pin)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In addition to these diadems composed of many
minute parts, the simplest and probably the most
usual form is that of a flat band increasing in breadth
towards the middle, and ending there sometimes in
a blunt point marked by a palmette.</p>

<p>Pins that served the purpose of fastening up and
decorating the hair vary in style, their heads being
formed sometimes of flowers, and sometimes of animals
or human figures, resembling those employed as pendants
to earrings. Probably the most important is the
handsome pin in the British Museum from Paphos in
Cyprus (<a href="#PLATE_IV">Pl. IV, 6</a>). The head,
surmounted with a bead
of Egyptian porcelain with a pearl above, is in the
form of a capital of a column. At the four corners
are projecting heads of bulls, and between these are
open cups or flowers, towards which four doves with
outstretched wings bend as if to drink.</p>

<p>Typical necklaces of the best period consist of a
chain about three-eighths of an inch in width, of closely
plaited gold wire. From this are suspended numerous
smaller chains, masked at the top by small rosettes and
hung below with vases, spindle-shaped pieces, or a
rhythmical combination of other ornaments covered with
fine filigree. The British Museum possesses several
superb necklaces. To the finest one, found in the
island of Melos, colour is added by means of green
and blue enamel (<a href="#PLATE_V">Pl. V, 3</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span>
Bracelets and armlets, which are rarer than necklaces,
are of three forms: a fine plaited chain, like
that of the necklaces, united by a clasp in the form of a
knot; repouss&eacute; plaques hinged together; and a circlet
of beaten gold of more solid construction.</p>

<p>The primary object of the finger ring was its use
as a convenient method of carrying the engraved stone
which was to serve as a signet. Hence in early times
more attention was paid to the engraving of the gem
set in the ring than to its mounting. Many early rings
are entirely of gold and made generally of one piece,
with a large flat bezel engraved like a gem. A great
number of them, though apparently solid, are hollow,
and formed of gold leaf punched into shape and then
filled up with mastic to preserve the form. The ornamental
rings of the later Greeks have been found chiefly
in the luxurious colonies of Magna Gr&aelig;cia. One of the
most charming designs is in the shape of a serpent
which coils itself many times round the finger, with its
head and tail lying along the finger. It is worthy of
remark that though a number of Greek rings are in
existence, never in Greek art, as in Etruscan and
Roman, do we find any representation of the human
figure with rings on the fingers.</p>

<p>In earlier times simple pins formed of gold wire
appear to have been often employed to fasten the dress.
Bow-shaped brooches were also worn, but few gold
brooches are met with except those belonging to the
later Greek ornaments. These are characterised by a
small arched bow and a long sheath for the point of the
pin decorated with designs in fine filigree.</p>

<p>The goldsmith's art is much more limited in its
application to girdles than to head or neck ornaments;
and yet, as is well known, girdles formed an important
item in the dress of men and women. The girdle over
which the long tunic hung in deep folds was often of
simple cords with tassels affixed to the ends: thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span>
Homer speaks of Hera as wearing a "zone from which
a hundred tassels hang." Girdles appear to have been
mainly of soft ligaments, which probably, with the
increase of luxury, were adorned with gold ornamentations.
It is remarkable, at all events, that those species
of gold ornament that can certainly be recognised as
girdles are obvious imitations of textile fabrics.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the ornaments found at Mycen&aelig;
which were employed by the primitive Greeks for
decorating their garments are thin plates of gold,
termed <i>bracte&aelig;</i>, pierced with small holes, which served
the later Greeks for similar purpose. They are repouss&eacute;,
and have clearly been stamped with dies, for
the designs on them show constant repetition. They
are of various sizes and shapes, and it is evident that
some were meant to be worn as single ornaments, while
others, sewn on in lines, formed regular borders or
designs on the robes. It is possible that, like the ball-shaped
buttons met with in many fanciful formations,
some of more solid construction served the purpose of
clasps that drew together the dress at intervals along
the arm, and acted as fastenings at the neck or on the
shoulder. Some attachments of this kind in the form
of round discs, with their gold surface richly ornamented
with filigree and also with enamel, may have been
actual brooches and have had hinged pins affixed
below.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center"><b>ETRUSCAN JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar
passion for jewellery. Even in early times,
when the excessive use of personal ornament
was considered a mark of effeminacy, they were famed
for their jewels. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, speaking
of the Sabines, says that "they wore bracelets on their
left arms, and rings, for they were a gold-wearing
nation, and not less effeminate than the Etruscans."
Like most other nations of antiquity, the Etruscans
dedicated to the service of the dead costly articles of
adornment which they had worn when living; though
the greater number of these jewels are flimsy objects
made for mortuary purposes. On Etruscan sarcophagi
the men have torques about their necks, while the
women have sometimes torques, sometimes necklaces,
long earrings, and bracelets, and both sexes have many
rings on their fingers.</p>

<p>Though systematically rifled in former times, Etruscan
tombs have yet preserved to the present day a
large number of jewels, sufficient to prove that the
possibilities of gold were never more thoroughly grasped
than by the Etruscans. Their earlier jewellery&mdash;for
the later is much coarser&mdash;shows extraordinary fineness
and elaboration of workmanship. They possessed a
peculiar art of fusing and joining metals by the use of
solvents unknown to us, which rendered invisible the
traces of solder. Surface decoration was produced by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span>
the interweaving of extremely delicate threads of gold,
by a sparing use of enamel, and particularly by the
soldering together of particles or globules of gold of
such minuteness and equality as to be scarcely perceptible
to the naked eye. Animal or human forms were
skilfully executed in relief by repouss&eacute;, or produced in
the round with the assistance of solder. But the chief
characteristic of their jewellery, and that which mainly
distinguishes it from the Greek, is its ornamentation
with grains of gold of microscopic size.</p>

<p>The method of decorating the surface of gold with
fine granules, which is usually termed granulation, is
one which was in favour among all ancient gold workers
in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. The
"pulvisculus aureus," as it was called in Italy, came
into common use towards the close of the Mycen&aelig;an
Age, at a time when the Ph&oelig;nicians were making
their influence felt in Cyprus, Sardinia, and Etruria,
where examples of this method of gold working particularly
abound. We are probably right in assuming
that this granulated work was indigenous to
the Eastern Mediterranean, and that, as it has been
found upon jewels of undoubted Ph&oelig;nician origin, the
Ph&oelig;nicians were not uninstrumental in disseminating
it along their trade routes. Cellini, in his description
of the process of granulation in his <i>Trattato dell'
Oreficeria</i>, speaks of each grain being made separately
and soldered on, a technique probably practised by the
ancient jewellers. But in the case of the minutest
Etruscan work, it is not improbable that the grains&mdash;at
first natural, though subsequently artificial&mdash;were
sprinkled like dust over the parts of the surface which
had to be covered. This fine granulation belongs only
to the early and best Etruscan jewels. Larger grains
were used for later work.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the secrets of the old Etruscan
goldsmiths have never been wholly recovered in Europe.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span>
That the art of granulation, though mentioned by
Cellini, was not generally practised by the goldsmiths
of the Renaissance is evident from the examples of
their work that have survived. In recent years attempts
have been made to revive the art; but as the well-known
productions of Castellani the elder, with his
Alessandro the connoisseur and Augusto, and of
Carlo Giuliano, are connected with the later history of
jewellery, further reference will be made to them subsequently.</p>

<p>As might be expected, important collections of
Etruscan jewellery are preserved in museums close to
the sites where the objects themselves have been
discovered. One of the most extensive of such collections
is that in the museum of the Vatican, which was
brought together by Pope Gregory XVI from the
districts which till 1870 formed part of the papal
domain. The British Museum, the Louvre, and the
museums of Berlin and Munich all contain a large
number of ornaments from the old cemeteries of the
Etruscan races. The earliest Etruscan jewellery coincides
roughly with Greek work of the late Mycen&aelig;an
period, and betrays, from the religious symbols expressed
on it, a marked Oriental or Egyptian influence.
At a somewhat later date, that is from about 500 to
300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, it is evident that the Etruscans
largely followed
Greek models, or imported from Greece, especially from
Ionia, some of the finest artists in the precious metals.
Etruscan jewellery can then be divided into three
distinct styles: the primitive, somewhat Oriental in
character, and of fine but not artistically attractive
work; the later, when the primitive art had been subjected
to Hellenic influence and produced work of the
highest artistic and technical excellence; and the latest
style, in which Greek art, still followed, but in a vulgarised
form, results in ornaments noticeable for their size
and coarseness of execution.</p>

<div class="box">
<a name="PLATE_VI" id="PLATE_VI"></a>
<p style="margin-left: 30em;"><i>PLATE VI</i></p>

<span class="caption2">(pins, necklaces, earrings)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>
The Etruscans appear to have paid particular attention
to the decoration of the head. Following a custom
in vogue throughout Greece, men as well as women
adorned themselves with fillets; while women also wore
highly ornate hair-pins, with heads shaped like balls,
acorns, and pomegranates, decorated in granulation.
Many of these pins must have served to fix the diadems
and fillets for which the Etruscans appear to have had an
especial liking. The latter are composed for the most
part of the foliage of myrtle, ivy, and oak, in accordance
with the symbolical ideas attached to these leaves. The
greater number are of plate of gold, so thin and fragile
that they can only have been employed as sepulchral
ornaments&mdash;like the wreath of ivy leaves and berries of
thin gold still encircling the bronze helmet from Vulci
in the Room of Greek and Roman Life in the British
Museum, and a similar wreath of bracteate gold around
a conical bronze helmet in the Salle des Bijoux Antiques
of the Louvre.</p>

<p>Earrings of the finest period bear a striking similarity
to Greek ornaments of the same date. The first
type is penannular in shape, one end terminating in
the head of a bull or lion, and the other in a point
which pierces the ear. To this ring is next attached a
pendant. In the third type the hook which pierces the
ear is hidden by a rosette or disc from which hang
tassel-shaped appendages, and in the middle between
them small animals enamelled white, such as the geese,
swans, and cocks in the British Museum, and the
peacocks and doves in the Campana Collection in
the Louvre. Earrings of another class are saddle-shaped,
formed like an imperfect cylinder, one end
of which is closed by an open-work rose cap, which
completely enclosed the lobe of the wearer's ear.
The latest Etruscan earrings, of pendant form, are
mostly of great size and in the shape of convex
bosses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span>
In examining the very primitive necklaces and
other ornaments that have been discovered in various
tombs in Italy, especially in Etruria and Latium, the
extraordinary abundance of amber at once attracts
attention. The amber of this ancient jewellery of Italy
has accessories, sometimes of gold, and more frequently
of silver, or else of an alloy of gold and silver termed
<i>electrum</i>. A noteworthy early necklace of these materials
found at Pr&aelig;neste, and now in the British Museum,
is composed of amber cylinders, and pendent vases alternately
of amber and electrum (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Pl. VI, 2</a>).</p>

<p>Though the majority of Etruscan necklaces aim at
largeness of display, some are as delicate and refined as
the best Greek ornaments. From a round plaited chain
in the British Museum hangs a single ornament&#8212;-the
mask of a faun whose hair, eyebrows, and wavy beard
are worked with fine granulation; another pendant
is a negro's head on which the granules are disposed
with exquisite skill to represent the short woolly hair
(<a href="#PLATE_VI">Pl. VI, 5</a>). Finer even than either of
these&mdash;and a
remarkable example of the combination of the two
processes of filigree and granulation&mdash;is a neck pendant
in the form of a mask of Dionysos (Bacchus) in
the Campana Collection in the Louvre. On this the
curls of hair over the forehead are represented by
filigree spirals, while the beard is worked entirely in
the granulated method.</p>

<p>A large number of necklaces have evidently been
produced simply for sepulchral purposes, for they are
composed, like the majority of crowns, of the thinnest
bracteate gold in the shape of rosettes and studs strung
together.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of Etruscan necklaces is
their ornamentation with pendent <i>bull&aelig;</i>. The bulla,
from the Latin word meaning a bubble, was usually
made of two concave plates of gold fastened together so
as to form a globe&mdash;lentoid or vase-shaped&mdash;within
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span>
which an amulet was contained. In Etruscan art both
men and women are represented wearing necklaces and
even bracelets formed of bull&aelig;. Occasionally, instead
of a bulla, is some such object as the tooth or claw
of an animal or a small primitive flint arrow-head,
which served as an amulet.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of bracelets of primitive work are a famous pair in
the British Museum, which were discovered in a tomb
at Cervetri (C&aelig;re). They are composed of thin plates
of gold measuring 8 inches in length by 2&frac14; inches in
width, divided into six sections, ornamented with scenes
thoroughly Assyrian in character, indicated by lines of
microscopic granulations (<a href="#PLATE_VII">Pl. VII, 4</a>).</p>

<p>Etruscan fibul&aelig; of gold are generally formed of a
short arc-shaped bow and a long sheath for the pin
decorated with minute granular work. Upon the upper
surface are often rows of small models of animals.
Upon the sheath of a large early fibula found at Cervetri
(C&aelig;re), and now in the British Museum, is a double row
of twenty-four standing lions (<a href="#PLATE_VII">Pl. VII, 1</a>). The
bow of the
later fibul&aelig; is sometimes in the form of a single figure,
as that of a crouching lion. A considerable number
of small fibul&aelig; of this type appear to have been worn
in rows down the seam of the dress. Two series of
these, the one numbering twenty-one and the other
thirty-nine, both found in a tomb at Vulci, are in the
Louvre.</p>

<p>The Etruscans appear to have had a special love for
rings; every finger, including the thumb, was covered
with them, and a considerable number have been discovered
in the tombs. The majority are composed
of scarabs mounted much in the same style as those
of the Egyptians. One of the finest Etruscan rings in
the British Museum is formed by two lions, whose
bodies make up the shank, their heads and fore-paws and
supporting a bezel in filigree which holds the signet
stone&mdash;a small scarab&aelig;us charged with a lion regardant.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span>
Another remarkable class of Etruscan rings has large
oval bezels measuring upwards of an inch and a half
across. These are set with an engraved gem, and have
wide borders ornamented with various designs. An
example in the British Museum shows a pattern formed
of dolphins and waves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><b>ROMAN JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE foundation of the designs of Roman jewellery
is to be found among the ornaments of the ancient
Latin and Etruscan races which Rome subdued.
That there is considerable resemblance also between
Roman and Greek jewellery is natural, for the Romans,
having plundered first Sicily and Southern Italy, and
then Greece itself, induced Greek workmen with more
refined instincts than their own to eke out a precarious
living as providers of luxurious ornaments. It is worthy
of remark that, owing to various causes, Greek and
Etruscan jewellery has survived in considerably greater
quantity than has that from the much more luxurious
times of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>It is customary to associate Roman jewellery with a
degree of luxury which has not been surpassed in
ancient or modern times. Roman moralists, satirists,
and comic poets refer again and again to the extravagance
of their own day. The first named, from a
sombre point of view, condemn the present to the
advantage of the past; and the others, with a distorted
view, study exceptional cases, and take social monstrosities
as being faithful representations of the whole of
society. Under the Republic nearly all ornaments were
worn for official purposes, and the wearing of precious
stones was prohibited except in rings; but in imperial
times they were worn in lavish profusion, and successive
emperors, by a series of sumptuary laws, attempted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span>
to check the progress of this extravagance. Many
instances might be quoted of excessive luxury in the
use of precious stones, like that of the lady described
by Pliny, who at a simple betrothal ceremony was
covered with pearls and emeralds from head to foot.
Yet Roman luxury was not without its parallel in later
ages. For in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
we read how at court the women carried their whole
fortunes in a single dress. Further, as far as can be
judged, the personal ornaments of the ancients were for
the most part subject to much less frequent change of
fashion than is inevitable under the social conditions of
more modern times.</p>

<p>With regard to ornaments of the head, diadems
and fillets were much worn. Ladies of the Roman
Empire dressed their hair in the most elaborate manner,
and adorned it with pearls, precious stones, and other
ornaments. For fixing their head-dresses, and for
arranging the hair, they made use of long hair-pins. A
gold specimen preserved in the British Museum is
upwards of eight inches in length; it has an octagonal
shaft crowned with a Corinthian capital, on which stands
a figure of Aphrodite (<a href="#PLATE_VIII">Pl. VIII, 3</a>).</p>

<p>Pearls were in particular favour as ornaments for
the ears. Introduced into Rome about the time of
Sulla, pearls were imported in large quantities during
the Roman domination of Egypt. In Vespasian's
time Pliny, referring to earrings, says: "They seek
for pearls at the bottom of the Red Sea, and search
the bowels of the earth for emeralds to decorate
their ears." Perfect spherical pearls of delicate whiteness
were termed <i>uniones</i> (i.e. unique), since no two
were found exactly alike. Pear-shaped pearls, called
<i>elenchi</i>, were prized as suitable for terminating the
pendant, and were sometimes placed two or three
together for this purpose. Thus worn, they were
entitled <i>crotalia</i> (rattles), from the sound produced as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span>
they clashed together. "Two pearls beside each other,"
Seneca complains, "with a third on the top now go to a
single pendant. The extravagant fools probably think
their husbands are not sufficiently plagued without
their having two or three heritages hanging down from
their ears." Earrings with single pendants were called
<i>stalagmia</i>.</p>

<p>It is especially to be noticed that the shapes of all
ancient jewellery and ornaments, particularly those of
the Romans, were in a great measure decided by a
belief in their magical efficiency. The wearing of
amulets was most frequent among the Romans of all
classes. They were generally enclosed in a <i>bulla</i>, and
suspended from the neck. A remarkable specimen of a
<i>bulla</i>, found at Herculaneum, and presented by the
Court of Naples to the Empress Josephine, is now in
the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. The lentoid-shaped
<i>bulla</i> was worn almost entirely by children, but other
pendants, shaped like pendent vases, or in the form of
a square or cylindrical box, were a not unusual ornament
of the necklace of Roman ladies. They probably
always possessed a symbolical meaning.</p>

<p>The simple neck-chain, whether supplied with the
appendage or not, was called a <i>monile</i>; the luxury of
latter times doubled or trebled the rows of chains.
These were often of finely plaited gold or else of links.
Other necklaces were composed of mounted precious
stones, the fashion for which appears to date from the
Oriental conquests of Pompey in the first
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Vast quantities of precious stones were brought into
Rome at that date; for the treasury of Mithridates,
captured at Talaura, contained, besides many other
precious objects, "jewels for the breast and neck all
set with gems."</p>

<p>The Romans also wore necklaces (<i>monilia baccata</i>)
composed of beads of various materials, both precious
stones and glass, of many colours and various shapes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span>
Amber was largely employed for the purpose, and held
in high estimation by Roman ladies, who regarded it
not only as an ornament, but as a talisman for protection
against danger, especially witchcraft. Amber
in which small insects were enclosed was particularly
prized: "the price," says Pliny, "of a small figure in it,
however diminutive, exceeds that of a living healthy
slave."</p>

<p>Both cameos and large intaglios were in frequent
use as pendent ornaments, and in the most recent
pieces of Roman jewellery imperial gold coins were
employed for rings, bracelets, and especially for pendants
to necklaces. For the latter purpose they are not
infrequently found set in <i>opus interrasile</i>&mdash;the open-work
characteristic of late Roman jewellery. The best
example of cameos and coins mounted thus is a necklace
in the Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles at
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In the case of bracelets (<i>armill&aelig;</i>) which were
favourite ornaments among the Romans, two kinds
have to be noticed. The first, termed <i>dextrocherium</i>,
was meant to be worn round the right wrist, and follows
the same rules of formation as the necklace, but no
pendent motives are introduced. Other bracelets are
formed of two rounded halves of solid character, hinged,
and closed by a snap. The second kind of bracelet or
armlet, worn on the upper arm, was the <i>brachiale</i> or
<i>torques brachialis</i>; another was the <i>spinther</i>, which kept
its place on the arm by its own elasticity. The difference,
however, between the different Latin terms for the
armlet is somewhat obscure. Originally of pure gold,
bracelets were subsequently set with precious stones and
engraved gems, and, like the specimen in the Imperial
Cabinet at Vienna, with coins dating from the third
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> The serpent form appears
to have been
a favourite one among Roman ladies, and a fine pair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span>
of armlets of this design are in the Victoria and Albert
Museum (<a href="#PLATE_VIII">Pl. VIII, 11</a>).</p>

<p>The Romans appear to have been more extravagant
in their rings than any other people. Very few ornamental
rings are earlier in date than the time of the
Empire, when the passion for gold rings adorned with
precious stones and engraved gems seems to have pervaded
all classes; and it reached such extravagance that
Martial speaks of a man who wore six on every finger,
and recommends another who had one of monstrous
size to wear it on his leg instead of his hand. Some
individuals, we learn, had different sets of rings for
summer and winter, those for the latter season being
too heavy for hot weather. Their weight was sometimes
very great, and it is not to be wondered that
complaint was made of their liability to slip off when
the finger was greasy at a meal.</p>

<p>Even until the latest times the ring retained its
original purpose as a means of distinction or of recognition,
and was used by its wearer to impress his seal on
documents and private property. It continued also to
be associated with the idea of power and privilege
especially bestowed upon the individual. Thus the
Roman paterfamilias wore on his finger a ring with
a small key attached. Every Roman appears to have
chosen at pleasure the subject or device for his signet&mdash;a
portrait of a friend or an ancestor, or some subject
from poetry or mythology. Each of these devices
became associated with a particular person, and served,
like the coat-of-arms of later centuries, as a mark
of identification.</p>

<p>The commonest variety of ring is formed of a plain
band of gold which widens and thickens towards the
bezel, and is set with a small stone. The latter is
generally engraved, but is often quite plain. The
similarity of the convex sardonyx to an eye often
struck the ancients, and may account for this stone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span>
being frequently found unengraved in rings, and set in
a collet, itself shaped into the form of a human eye.
Such rings were no doubt worn as amulets. Rings
containing stones set in this manner have sometimes
a flattened hoop and open-work shoulders. Other distinctly
ornamental rings, known by the Romans as
<i>polypsephi</i>, are formed of two or more rings united
together.</p>

<p>A large number of Roman rings are of bronze, and
the key rings referred to are, with a very few exceptions,
of this material. Iron and bronze rings were not infrequently
gilded. Such rings, according to Pliny, were
called Samothracian. Rings in the form of snakes were
very popular, as were those shaped like a Herculean
knot. Like other articles of jewellery, rings are sometimes
set with gold coins of the late Empire. A few
ornamental rings have high pyramidal bezels which were
sometimes hollow, and were made to contain poison.
Hannibal killed himself with a dose of poison which he
carried about with him in his ring; so did the officer in
charge of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. "Being
arrested," says Pliny, "he broke the stone of his ring
between his teeth and expired on the spot."</p>

<p class="center"><b>BYZANTINE JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE peculiar interest of Byzantine jewellery lies,
not only in its own composite nature, but in the
great influence it exercised on European ornaments
during the greater part of the Middle Ages.
Byzantine jewellery is the result of a compromise between
Oriental and Western influences. It retains the
craftsmanship of ancient Rome and the dignity of
classical traditions modified by Christian ideas, and to
these it unites the skill in patient and exuberant decoration
in which the Oriental workman excels.</p>

<p>The new era, inaugurated in 330 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
by the transfer
by Constantine of the seat of empire to the old colony
of Byzantium, was marked at first by a retention of the
Greek and Latin influences; but the quantities of pearls
and precious stones that passed through Constantinople,
the highway of commerce between Europe and the East,
soon rendered the workmen of the Empire susceptible
to the magnificence of Oriental decoration. Owing to the
irruption of Oriental ideas in the sixth century consequent
on the sack of Antioch by the Persians and the conquests
of Belisarius, splendour of material began to
supersede the refinement of classical times. This tendency
is admirably displayed on the rich mosaics of the
period, especially those in the church of San Vitale
at Ravenna in Italy, which represent the Emperor
Justinian and his wife Theodora. The Empress and
her attendants are clothed in robes stiffened with gold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span>
and set with precious stones; pearls, rubies, and
emeralds encircle her neck and shoulders, and, entirely
covering her head, hang down from the temples in rich
festoons upon the breast. Justinian also has a diadem
upon his head, and a purple and gold embroidered
mantle fastened with a monstrous fibula hung with
triple pendants.</p>

<p>The outbreak of iconoclasm in the eighth century
had its influence on jewellery in causing the banishment
of forms ornamented with the proscribed figures. But
the iconoclastic movement was also of very great importance,
since many goldsmiths driven from their
country by the decrees of Leo III established themselves
in Italy, Germany, and Gaul, carrying with them the
processes and designs of Byzantine art.</p>

<p>The restoration of images by Basil the Macedonian
in the ninth century opened an important period of revival
of industry and art, which lasted until the sack
of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204. The active
overland trade with India which had been kept up for
many years, with no small influence on the ornaments
of the West, was much augmented; while the commercial
relations with Persia were maintained.</p>

<p>It was during the period from the tenth century
onwards that the influence of Byzantine art was most
strongly felt in the West, owing to the connection which
was established between the German court and Constantinople,
through the marriage of the Emperor
Otho II with the Byzantine Princess Theophano,
daughter of Romanus, in 972.</p>

<p>A considerable proportion of Byzantine ornaments,
as shown by the mosaics, consisted of gems sewn upon
the dress. Actual specimens of jewellery are naturally
of considerable rarity. The British Museum contains
a small but representative
collection.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They show a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span>
difference from the jewels of classical times chiefly in
the substitution of coarse repouss&eacute; and open-work&mdash;the
<i>opus interrasile</i> of later Roman work&mdash;for fine filigree
and granulation; yet filigree was employed with skill,
and exercised a considerable influence on the work of
European craftsmen. In general form the ornaments
of the Lower Empire retained the character of ancient
work, but added to it fresh designs to suit the change
of religion with its accompanying symbolism. Enamel
and coloured stones, employed with a reserve in
antique ornaments, now formed the chief artistic
aspect of jewellery. Cloisonn&eacute; inlay, that is to say the
incrustation of glass or garnet in cells, was made use
of, but cloisonn&eacute; enamel was preferred. In the majority
of ornaments, however, precious stones appear to have
predominated.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>As ornaments for the head, wreaths were worn,
especially upon festal occasions. From the earliest
Christian times the bride and bridegroom at their
wedding wore, as in some countries at the present day,
crowns of gold, silver, green leaves, or flowers, which
were afterwards returned to the church.</p>

<p>Early Byzantine earrings naturally follow the Roman
patterns. Some take the form of a penannular wire
loop holding a thimble-shaped cage of filigree, the
flat end of which is closed, and has in the centre a
setting for a precious stone. The majority of Byzantine
earrings are, however, of a peculiar design. The most
usual type, from the sixth century onwards, is crescent-shaped,
formed of gold repouss&eacute; and open-worked in
the form of a cross pat&eacute;e within a circle, supported on
either side by peacocks confronted. Dating from the
finest period, i.e. about the twelfth century, is a pair of
earrings in the British Museum, in the shape of a
segment of a circle, ornamented on both sides with
figures of birds in blue, green, and white cloisonn&eacute;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span>
enamel. Upon the outer border of each segment are
pearls fixed upon radiating pins, alternating with pyramids
of pellets; on the inner is a disc decorated with
similar enamels.</p>

<p>The cross is naturally the most favourite of pendants;
yet this symbol does not appear to have been
commonly worn on the person till about the fifth
century. Among the most interesting pectoral crosses
in the British Museum is one inscribed with a text
from Galatians <span class="smcap">vi.</span> 14; upon its
arms and lower part
are rings for pendent gems, and in the centre the
setting for a stone. Another cross, ornamented with
nielloed<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> figures of our Lord, the Virgin, and two
angels or military saints, has the name of its owner
inscribed at the back. Both date from about the tenth
or eleventh century. One of the finest and the best
known of such ornaments is the gold and enamelled
pectoral cross in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
known as the Beresford-Hope Cross. This remarkable
specimen of Byzantine jewellery, dating from about the
eighth century, is formed of two cruciform plates of
gold, hinged so as to form a reliquary, and set in a
silver-gilt frame of later workmanship than the cross
itself. The figures upon it, executed in translucent
cloisonn&eacute; enamel, represent on one part the Saviour on
the cross, with busts of the Virgin and St. John on
either side, and on the other a full-length figure of
the Virgin and the heads of four saints (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX, 8</a>).
Jewellery ornamented in this manner is of great rarity;
being executed nearly always upon pure gold, it has
seldom escaped the crucible.</p>

<p>Judging from the mosaics, as, for example, the
portraits of Justinian in the churches of San Vitale
and Sant' Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna, brooches of the
circular type appear to have been generally worn. Their
chief characteristic was the presence of three chains set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span>
with jewels attached to them by loops. Coins, as in
Roman times, were frequently mounted as brooches in
a beaded or open-work edging. Bow-shaped brooches
were worn, but not after the sixth century. Three
inscribed examples of the fourth century, one of
them of gold, are in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Similar in workmanship to the crescent-shaped earrings
described above, and of about the same date, is a
remarkable gold bracelet in the Franks Bequest. It is
formed of an open-work hoop decorated with swans and
peacocks enclosed in scrolls issuing from a vase. A
circular medallion with a repouss&eacute; bust of the Virgin
forms the clasp.</p>

<p>Finger rings have survived in greater numbers than
other Byzantine ornaments. The majority are figured
with the beautiful symbolism of the Christian belief.
Some are set with engraved gems, but on most the
design is produced by the more simple process of
engraving the metal of which the ring is composed.
In early Christian times rings were often offered as
presents, and were engraved with expressions of good-will
towards the recipient, whose name is sometimes
mentioned. The British Museum contains a somewhat
extensive collection of these rare objects in gold.
Bronze, often gilded, is naturally the commoner
material. Silver appears to have been scarcely ever
employed. The interest of the majority of Byzantine
rings arises rather from the subjects with which they
are associated, than from the quality of their workmanship.
There is, however, in the British Museum a very
beautiful example of pierced gold work in the form of
a key ring with projecting tongue, of a kind much
used in Roman times, which opened the lock by
lifting a latch. Upon the front of a wide hoop are the
words <i>Accipe dulcis</i>, in letters reserved in metal in a
pierced ground. The remainder of the hoop is divided
into compartments, each containing one letter of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span>
inscription <i>Multis annis</i>. Above the inscription, in
front, is a rectangular projection, perhaps for insertion
into a lock. It is finely pierced with a design in the
form of Greek crosses (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX, 10</a>).</p>

<p>The sack of Constantinople by the French and
Venetians dealt the death-blow to Byzantine art. Until
well into the thirteenth century the Byzantine goldsmiths
continued to exercise an important influence on
their contemporaries, and transmitted to the artists of
medi&aelig;val Europe such of the processes and designs of
antique art as they had preserved. Their intercourse
was closest with Russia, whose jewellery for centuries,
even up to the present day, has followed the designs of
the old Byzantine workmen.</p>

<p class="center"><b>PREHISTORIC (CELTIC) JEWELLERY</b><br />
<b>ROMANO-BRITISH JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE early ornaments of the greater part of
Europe remained until late times entirely untouched
by the culture prevalent in Italy and
Greece. Though of great arch&aelig;ological importance, as
revealing successive stages of culture, they do not at
the present demand very detailed consideration.</p>

<p>The decoration of the earliest jewellery of Europe&mdash;that
of the Bronze Age, which dates roughly from about
a thousand years before the Christian era&mdash;is by means
of spiral and zigzag patterns. Ornaments have free
endings, bent in spiral, snail-shell coils. The earliest
were cast, though the hammer was used towards the
close of the period; solder was unknown, and rivets
alone employed. Gold and bronze were the only
metals employed, the latter being sometimes gilt by
means of thin gold plates, while amber is often found
used as a jewel.</p>

<p>Some idea of these early ornaments can be formed
from the discoveries of objects worn by the ancient
inhabitants of the British Isles. They are, however,
not very numerous or important until after the Bronze
Age, and until the Early Iron Age&mdash;known in England
as the Late Celtic period&mdash;is reached.</p>

<p>The ornaments of the Britons&mdash;that is to say the
Brythons or iron-using Celts&mdash;before they became subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span>
to Rome are somewhat rare, for few objects of value
were buried in graves. Such as have been found comprise
bronze pins, brooches, torques, and bracelets;
beads of amber, jet, bone, and glass, and bracelets also
of jet.</p>

<p>Golden ornaments, like those laid bare by Schliemann
at Mycen&aelig;, concealed either as votive offerings or
for the sake of security, have been brought to light from
time to time, occasionally in England and more frequently
in Ireland. Celtic literature and legend are full
of references to these golden ornaments, and classical
writers often make mention of them.</p>

<p>The simplest types of gold ornaments discovered in
England are rings formed of a rounded bar of equal
thickness throughout, bent into a circular form, and the
extremities left disunited. Their material is gold, so
pure and flexible that the rings can be easily opened to
be linked into a chain or strung upon a thin gold wire.
They were very probably employed for barter, and are
generally known as "ring-money." Other rings, crescent-shaped,
with ends tapering towards their extremities,
may have served both as ornaments and substitutes for
money. Others, again, are of gold wire shaped into a
sort of rope, or else formed of a simple bar twisted in an
ornamental manner. It has been suggested that the
simple penannular rings were nose-ornaments, and when
linked or strung together were worn as necklaces; also
that the more decorative rings were earrings. But
it is quite impossible to determine their actual use as
personal ornaments.</p>

<p>Massive torques employed by the Celts for the
purpose of adorning the neck are occasionally found
of pure gold. They consist of a long piece of metal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span>
twisted and turned into the form of a circle, with its
ends either terminating in a knob, or doubled back in
the form of a short hook, or swelling out into cup-like
terminations. Some are formed of a square bar
of gold twisted spirally, others of a flat bar twisted
in a lighter manner, or of more than one bar twisted
together.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Gold ornaments for the arms, known by the term
<i>armill&aelig;</i>, are sometimes of the same thickness throughout.
It is more usual to find them plain, though twisted
work was also applied to them. The majority have
dilated ends, or ends slightly concave. With others,
again, these cavities assume the form of a cup so expanded
as to present the appearance of a trumpet or the
calyx of a large flower. On ornaments somewhat resembling
the latter the dilated extremities are flat plates,
while the connecting part, diminutive in proportion to
their exaggerated size, is striated longitudinally. These
objects are usually described as dress-fasteners, but the
exact purpose for which they were employed is still
a matter of doubt.</p>

<p>Advanced skill in the art of enamelling is one of the
most notable features of the Late Celtic period, which
itself extended from the prehistoric Age of Iron and
over the period of the Roman occupation. This enamel,
executed by the champlev&eacute; process on copper and bronze,
served for the decoration of massive bronze penannular
bracelets, and for bronze pins with wheel-shaped heads.
In addition to brooches&mdash;all of the safety-pin type&mdash;of an
immense variety of design, other primitive bronze ornaments,
usually of the spiral form characteristic of Celtic
work, include torques, armlets, and anklets. The torques
are mostly penannular and have enlarged terminals; the
armlets are often complete rings.</p>

<p>For the most extensive representation of the prehistoric
gold ornaments of the British Isles one must
look, not to England whose inhabitants generally assumed
the types of ornament in use among their Roman
conquerors, but to Ireland, where the Celtic traditions
were continued, and which has revealed vast hoards
of golden treasure. In Celtic England during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span>
Bronze and Early Iron Ages the majority of personal
ornaments are of bronze; in Ireland, however, at the
same periods the greater number are of gold. The
objects belonging to the Royal Irish Academy in
the Dublin Museum&mdash;perhaps the largest collection
in Europe of prehistoric gold ornaments&mdash;represent
merely a fraction of what, during the last few hundred
years, has been discovered and consigned to the
crucible.</p>

<p>Usually described as head-ornaments are certain
crescent or moon-shaped plates of thin gold, generally
decorated with engraved designs in parallel lines, with
angular lines between them, and having their extremities
formed into small flat circular discs. These gold
<i>lunettes</i> or <i>lunul&aelig;</i> are considered to have been worn
upright on the head and held in position by the terminal
plates set behind the
ears,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
but they were
very probably worn round the neck. The finest at
Dublin is of pure gold, weighing upwards of sixteen
ounces, and is richly ornamented with rows of conical
studs.</p>

<p>Torques are the most frequent of ancient Irish
ornaments. The largest known, over 5 feet long
and upwards of 27 ounces in weight, is supposed
to have been worn over the shoulder and across the
breast. It is the property of the Royal Irish Academy.
In addition to torques and gorgets, neck-ornaments were
also formed of beads of gold, and some of these have
been found accompanied by beads of amber. Besides
torque-shaped armlets, are bracelets composed of perfect
rings; but the penannular type, terminating mostly
with bulbous or cup-like ends, is commonest.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the prehistoric dress-fasteners,
known as <i>mammillary fibul&aelig;</i>, have been discovered
in Ireland. A slight enlargement of the ends
of the penannular ring develops into a cup-like expansion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span>
which increases to such a size that the ring
becomes simply the connecting link between the terminations.
The latter when flat are generally plain,
and when cup-shaped are often highly ornamented.
The finest of these fibul&aelig; at Dublin is 8&#8540; inches long,
and is of the extraordinary weight of 33 ounces.</p>

<p>Among other gold ornaments are certain circular
flat plates of thin gold, usually about 2&frac14; inches in
diameter, somewhat similar to the plates discovered
at Mycen&aelig;, in that they were evidently employed for
sewing upon the dress. In the middle of the plates
are small holes as if for attachment. As regards
"ring-money," and similar rings employed possibly as
ornaments for the ears or fingers, nothing more need
be said, as they usually follow the designs of those
in use among the Celts of Britain.</p>

<p>In a country like Ireland, which is famed for its
golden treasures, many strange stories of discoveries
have been recorded, yet few have excited greater interest
than the now famous Limavady treasure, which
in the year 1896 was ploughed up at Broighter, near
Limavady, in the county of Londonderry, in a field not
far from the shores of Lough Foyle. This hoard&mdash;probably
the most important which has ever been
unearthed of objects of this period&mdash;has been fully
described by Dr. A. J. Evans in Vol. LV of <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>.
It includes the following personal ornaments:
two gold chains, a torque formed of thick twisted
wires, and collar of very remarkable workmanship.
This collar consists of a hollow cylinder formed of two
plates soldered together, and fastened at the end
by a <b>T</b>-shaped projection and slot. The ornament is
repouss&eacute; work, in the trumpet pattern of the Late
Celtic period. The style of work upon these ornaments,
particularly that of the collar, associates them
with an artistic period which probably dates from the
first century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span>
The year following its discovery the whole find was
purchased by the British Museum, where its presence
at once figured as "another injustice to Ireland"; while
through the Press and in Parliament numerous attempts
were made to obtain its removal to Dublin.
The Irish claimed it as treasure-trove and maintained
that its legal home was the National Museum at Dublin.
The British Museum authorities replied that Dublin
had missed an opportunity of obtaining it in open
market, while they themselves, having acquired it in the
ordinary course of business, were precluded by statute
from parting with it. They further contended that the
ornaments were not necessarily of Irish workmanship,
but might with equal likelihood have been produced
in Britain. Thus for several years the dispute dragged
on, until in the summer of 1903 the case came up in
the Chancery Division of the Courts of Law (Attorney-General
<i>v.</i> Trustees of British Museum. <i>The Times
Law Reports</i>, XIX, p. 555.) Notwithstanding the ingenious
defence of the British Museum, judgment was
given that the ornaments were treasure-trove, and by
virtue of the Prerogative Royal must be surrendered
to the King. They were accordingly delivered to the
Crown authorities and presented to the Irish National
Museum by His Majesty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>ROMANO-BRITISH</b></p>

<p>Whatever races settled under the banner of Rome,
they accepted unreservedly its ornaments, dress and
manners, as well as its language and its laws. Hence
the jewellery which dates from the Roman occupation
of Britain (i.e. from about 43 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> to about 410 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
follows for the most part the Italian designs, and at the
same time differs but little from that brought to light
among the remains of Roman colonisation elsewhere.</p>

<p>The majority of Romano-British personal ornaments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span>
are of bronze&mdash;in most cases probably once gilt. Comparatively
few objects of gold have been found. Among
the articles of female adornment that occur in the
greatest abundance are pins, which were used for fixing
the hair in a knot behind the head, though some may
have been employed as dress-pins. They range from
3 to 9 inches in length, and have heads of various
designs, terminating in some instances in a bust or in a
figure. The majority are of bone, many are of bronze,
and a few are composed of coloured glass or jet.</p>

<p>A few necklaces of gold and bronze have been found,
but by far the greater number appear to have been
composed of beads of glass&mdash;in the manufacture of
which the Romans displayed remarkable skill. These
necklaces differ considerably in form and colour. The
commonest beads are spherical and pierced with a large
hole. They are usually of one colour, generally blue,
but some are of compound colours exquisitely blended,
and a few have a serpentine ornament fused into the
glass. Beads of amber, pearls, and glazed earthenware
have also been found.</p>

<p>A characteristic of Roman jewels executed in
Britain is their ornamentation with enamels. The
metal employed is generally bronze, the surface of
which is ornamented by the champlev&eacute; process;
that is to say, it is incised or grooved out (though
sometimes stamped or cast) in such a manner as to leave
floral or geometrical patterns in relief, and into the sunk
spaces thus formed are fused opaque enamels, principally
red, yellow, green, blue, and white.</p>

<p>This enamelling is generally found upon brooches
both of the circular and of the bow-shaped type. The
fronts of the circular brooches are flat, or raised like a
shield into several compartments of different colours.
The pin, which is hidden, moves freely on a pivot, and
its point is held by a catch. The finest specimen, discovered
in London, was formerly in the collection of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span>
Lord Hastings, from whom it was acquired by the
British Museum. It is a circular flat plaque, the pattern
on which consists of four quatrefoils with blue
centres on a red ground, and four small circles of
yellow enamel between them. In the centre is the
revolving figure of a dolphin (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI, 7</a>). Brooches
enamelled in a somewhat similar manner have been
found in France at Mont Beuvray, near Autun, and
are preserved in the Mus&eacute;e des Antiquit&eacute;s Nationales
at St. Germain.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Quite different are certain ornaments set with slices
cut from rods of millefiori glass, which were executed
for the most part during the decline of the Roman
power. One of the most elaborate is a brooch found
at Pont-y-Saison, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, in
1861, and preserved among other Romano-British
antiquities in the British Museum. It has an elaborate
pattern of chequered squares of red, white, and blue
(<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI, 6</a>). Brooches of the Gallo-Roman and early
Merovingian period appear to have been also decorated
in this manner.</p>

<p>Of bow-shaped brooches, or fibul&aelig;, there exists a
considerable number of varieties. Among these we
may distinguish the <b>T</b>-shaped fibula with long cylindrical
head, and a wide flat bow with sunk designs filled
with enamel. In another variety the bow passes through
a horizontal disc in its centre and assumes a form resembling
a tassel. Another common variety is the
crossbow form, either with a spiral or hinged head.
In many Roman fibul&aelig; the pin works on a hinge, but
in the variety known as the harp-shaped, the sheath
of the pin is filled in with a triangular plate, pierced
or solid, and the head is slightly expanded to suit
the coils of a spring.</p>

<p>In addition to the more formal types of brooches,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span>
many fancy devices, probably of Celtic origin, appear to
have been in vogue among the Roman colonists of
Great Britain. These are in the shape of birds, fish,
and all kinds of animals, brilliant with various coloured
enamels, which are often so disposed as to indicate
the spots or markings of the animals. A remarkable
series of brooches of this kind is in the possession of
Sir John Evans.</p>

<p>Bracelets and armlets, usually of bronze, have survived
in large numbers. They consist generally of a
simple narrow ring, such as could be slipped over the
wrist. Some are pennanular with tapering ends, others
are closed with a hook and eye, while a few have their
ends so twisted together that they can slide over one
another and so be taken on and off. Armlets of glass,
chiefly of a deep transparent blue, have also been
found.</p>

<p>Most of the varieties of finger rings already recorded
appear to have been worn in Britain. The extent of
the Roman civilisation can be measured by the number
of engraved stones enclosed in their settings or found
apart, the majority of which must have been executed
by lapidaries on the spot.</p>

<p>Many articles, such as rings, armlets, beads, buttons,
and amulets, were formed of jet or Kimmeridge shale,
turned on a lathe. In the Island of Purbeck round flat
pieces of jet have been found pierced with holes, which
are clearly refuse pieces of the turner&mdash;the nuclei
of rings and other articles. This material appears to
be the same as that termed by Pliny <i>gigates</i>. According
to him, it was supposed to possess the virtue of
driving away serpents; and personal ornaments made
of it were particularly prized. There seems little
doubt that the use of ornaments of Kimmeridge coal or
shale by the Romano-Britons was nothing more than
a survival of the Neolithic or Stone Age. "Great
Britain," writes M. Fontenay in 1887, with reference to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span>
the ancient practice of wearing ornaments of jet,
"remains faithful to its early customs; for at the
present day English ladies delight in adorning themselves
with jet jewellery." Fashion changes rapidly,
but it will be long, one hopes, before it again decrees
the general use of ornaments of this unattractive
material.</p>

<p class="center"><b>BARBARIC JEWELLERY OF EUROPE</b><br />
<b>(THE GREAT MIGRATIONS)</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">D</span>URING the period of the great migrations,
when hordes of barbarians swept like waves
across Europe over the tracks of Roman civilisation,
all traces of classical art rapidly vanished, save
in Constantinople, which remained, as it were, a corner
of the antique world. The forms of classical jewellery
in natural course either totally disappeared or underwent
a complete transformation, and there appeared
instead a new process for the decoration of personal
ornament, which in earlier times was practically unknown,
save to the goldsmiths of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Just as the desire to imitate precious stones led
to the introduction of enamel, so the Gothic nations
who hailed from the south-east corner of Europe
brought into jewellery the Oriental love for colour.
Coloured stones, usually garnets, or red glass, cut in
slices, were inlaid on a metal surface, or were placed
side by side, separated only by intervening strips
of metal. This process of inlay or incrustation is
of great importance, since almost every species of
jewellery in Europe from the third till about the
eighth century is thus decorated.</p>

<p>The Goths invented no new jewellery, but adapted
a style which had long been in existence. And though
the forms of their jewellery may be due to the growth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span>
of local traditions, its decoration is clearly the result
of influences connected in some way with the East.
Originating, as it doubtless did, in Persia or in the
further East, this process of inlay was adopted by the
Gothic nations during the earlier centuries of the Christian
era, and made its first appearance among them in
the districts of the Caucasus and in the Crimea. From
thence it passed to the Lombards in Italy, to the
Burgundians in Austria and Switzerland, the Visigoths
in Spain, the Merovingians in Gaul, the earlier Scandinavians
in Denmark; and by the Saxon tribes in
Northern Germany it was carried to England, where
it attained its highest perfection in the superb circular
brooches that have been brought to light in Kent.</p>

<p>By the discovery of specimens of Asiatic and Germanic
jewellery ornamented in this manner, the path
of the migratory tribes can thus be traced right across
the Continent. Yet for the reason that conditions
of property and nationality became altered from one
generation to another, the question to which of the
nations numerous pieces of jewellery are to be ascribed,
is difficult to solve. They are often connected with
misunderstood Hellenistic and Asiatic traditions, while
at the same time showing workmanship with barbaric
ideas of form.</p>

<p>There are, as has been pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> two very distinct
forms of inlay, one of which is possibly the
outcome of the other. One has been termed <i>plate
inlaying</i>, the other <i>cloisonn&eacute; inlaying</i>. The first is
represented in the east of Europe by the fibul&aelig; and
gorget in the celebrated treasure of Petrossa, and in
the west by the crown of Svinthila in the equally
famous treasure of Guarrazar. In these objects a gold
plate is pierced, and into the holes thus formed stones
are fixed by mastic, and supported from behind by a
second plate of gold. This form of inlaying seems to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span>
merge naturally into the other, for at a certain point
it may have occurred to the goldsmith to abandon the
continuous upper sheet of metal and to cut it into
strips to be placed edgewise between the stones. Thus
appeared the second form of inlaying, in the cloisonn&eacute;
manner. It is represented in its journey from the
East by the "Oxus treasure." In Europe it is illustrated
by numerous specimens of Teutonic jewellery
from Southern Europe, by the ornaments discovered in
the tomb of Childeric I, and finally by the splendid
Anglo-Saxon jewellery from the Kentish cemeteries.
Numbers of articles of jewellery dating from the fifth
century until the general introduction of Christianity
have been discovered in various localities in
Europe. But the above-mentioned hoards of treasure
demand special consideration, as being, not only the
most characteristic examples of the methods of inlay,
but also types of the utmost luxury of the period in
the way of personal ornaments. Beyond these no
general account of European jewellery need here be
given, since excavations in the Anglo-Saxon graves
have revealed examples of jewellery which may be
taken as fairly representative of the articles then in use
upon the Continent as well.</p>

<p>A description may now be given of some of the
principal and most typical of these European treasure-hoards,
dating from what are known as the "Dark
Ages." But attention must first be drawn to the important
Asiatic treasure found near the River Oxus, in
Bactria, in 1877. This "Oxus treasure,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> belonging
for the most part to the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, seems to
supply the missing link in the chain of evidence which
unites the ornamentation of European jewellery with
clearly defined Oriental methods. The chief articles of
jewellery in the hoard are two massive penannular
bracelets of gold, one in the British Museum, the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span>
at South Kensington. They are ornamented at each
end with a winged monster or gryphon in full relief.
The surface of the wings and necks of the figures is
covered with gold cloisons, once set with coloured
stones or pastes. The form and decoration of these
and the other articles of the treasure in the Franks
Bequest in the British Museum seem to indicate the
Persian origin of this inlaid work.</p>

<p>The "treasure of Petrossa," dating from the fourth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, contains some of the earliest examples of
inlaid jewellery in Europe. Few treasures of which
record has been preserved are equal to it in arch&aelig;ological
interest. It was discovered in 1837 by peasants
on the banks of a tributary of the Danube, near the
village of Petrossa, about sixty miles from Bucharest.
Much of it was broken up shortly after its discovery.
What remained was seized by the Government and
conveyed to the Museum of Antiquities at Bucharest,
where it is now preserved. The treasure includes a
gold torque with hooked ends, like the Celtic torques
from the British Isles; a crescent-shaped collar or
gorget of gold with its surface pierced in the manner
of plate inlay, and set with garnets and other stones;
three bird-shaped fibul&aelig;; and a larger ornament, also
in the shape of a bird, intended probably as a breast-plate.
The heads and necks of the birds are inlaid
in the cloisonn&eacute; manner; their lower parts are ornamented
with plate inlay.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Dating from the Merovingian period are the treasures
of King Childeric I in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at
Paris. The founder of the Merovingian dynasty died
in 481, and was buried at Tournai, in Languedoc, surrounded
by his treasures and robes of state. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span>
year 1653, when all memory of the place of his interment
had perished, a labourer accidentally uncovered
the royal grave and brought to light the treasure it contained.
The regalia consisted of a sword, a bracelet,
fibul&aelig;, buckles, about three hundred gold bees&mdash;the
decoration of a mantle&mdash;and a signet-ring of gold. This
ring was not set with a gem, but had its oval gold bezel
engraved with a full-faced bust holding a spear. It
bore the legend <span class="smcap">childirici regis.</span> On the night of
November 5, 1831, the Biblioth&egrave;que was broken into
by burglars. An alarm being given, they fled, and
threw their spoil, which included, amongst other
objects, Childeric's regalia, into the Seine. The river
was dredged, and a great part of the treasure was recovered.
The ring, however, was never found; but its
design is preserved in Chiflet's <i>Anastasis Childerici I</i>,
while the signet itself has been reconstructed from an
impression of the seal in wax, found in the Bodleian
Library in a copy of Chiflet's work, once the property
of the great antiquary, Francis Douce. Except on this
jewel, the traditional surface decoration of Teutonic
jewellery is admirably represented. Every item of the
treasure is inlaid with thin slices of garnet or red glass,
arranged in the cloisonn&eacute; manner between gold partitions.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The most wonderful, probably, of all treasures-trove
is the famous "treasure of Guarrazar," discovered in
1858 at a place called La Fuente de Guarrazar, near
Toledo.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It included eleven crowns of pure gold set
with precious stones. The peasants who unearthed the
treasure broke up the crowns and divided the spoil.
But the story of the discovery became known; and
having been pieced together, most of the crowns
were conveyed to the Mus&eacute;e Cluny at Paris, and the
remainder placed in the Real Armer&iacute;a at Madrid. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span>
most important of those at Madrid is the crown of
King Svinthila (621-631). Its surface is pierced with
holes arranged in rose-shaped patterns, and set with
large pearls and cabochon sapphires. From the lower
rim hangs a fringe of letters set in the cloisonn&eacute;
manner with red glass paste, suspended by chains.
The letters form the inscription <span class="smcap">svintilanus rex offeret.</span>
The chief crown in the treasure at Paris
is that of King Reccesvinthus (649-672). It consists
of a broad circle of gold, 8 inches in diameter,
mounted with thirty huge Oriental pearls and thirty
large sapphires, all set in high collets and separated
by pierced open-work. The margins are bands of cloisonn&eacute;
work with inlays of red glass. Suspended
below by twenty-four chains are letters of gold inlaid
like the borders forming the words
<img src="images/cross.png" width="15" height="15" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">reccesvinthus
rex offeret.</span> Attached to each letter is a square collet
hung with a pear-shaped sapphire. The crown is suspended
by four chains from a foliated ornament encircled
with pendent pearls and sapphires, and surmounted
by a capital of rock crystal. A massive cross
4&frac14; inches long and 2&frac12; inches wide hangs below the
crown. It is set with eight enormous pearls and six
large and brilliant sapphires, the latter mounted in
high open bezels. From its foot and limbs hang three
paste imitations of emeralds, with pear-shaped sapphires
below. The combination of the pure gold with
the violet sapphires and the somewhat faded lustre of
the pearls produces an exceedingly harmonious effect
of colour.</p>

<p>The majority of these crowns were votive offerings
to a church, to be hung above the altar; the larger ones
may have been actually used at coronations, and afterwards
suspended in some consecrated building and the
dedicatory inscriptions attached in remembrance of the
ceremony. They certainly appear to be native work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span>
of the Spanish Visigoths, executed under the influence
of the style prevailing in the Eastern Empire. At a
date not long after their production, the use of this
particular species of decoration of jewellery, owing
probably to the revival of the art of enamelling, rapidly
declined in western Europe; and though it continued
to be practised in the East, it had virtually disappeared
at the close of the Merovingian period&mdash;by about the
year 800, when Charlemagne was crowned Emperor
of the West.</p>

<p class="center"><b>ANGLO-SAXON JEWELLERY (FIFTH TO SEVENTH CENTURY)&mdash;<br />
MEROVINGIAN JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">U</span>PON the invasion of Britain by the Teutonic
races in the fifth century personal ornaments
lost their Roman character, and assumed a
peculiar type which betrays the impress of a fresh
nationality on design and workmanship.</p>

<p>A near alliance by origin and geographical position
existed between the Jutes, Angles, and other kindred
tribes commonly known as the Saxons, who settled in
Britain, and the Franks, who stationed themselves in
Gaul. The ornaments of all these tribes bear on this
account a close similarity. Hence Anglo-Saxon jewels
may for the most part be taken as representative of all
the rest; and the only contemporary Merovingian
ornaments to be noticed will be those that differ from
the Anglo-Saxon types.</p>

<p>In England as well as in France this remarkable
group of jewellery belongs to the period which immediately
followed the extinction of the Roman power in
both countries, and extends from the fifth to the middle
of the seventh century. Personal ornaments in England
were the last in Europe to receive a characteristic species
of surface decoration: for Kent and the Isle of Wight
form the extreme limit of the geographical area in
which jewellery ornamented with cloisonn&eacute; inlay has
been found. The process attained here the highest
point of excellence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon jewellery occupies an exceedingly
important position in the history of the goldsmith's art.
Its beauty lies in its delicate goldwork and peculiarly
harmonious blending of colours. So remarkable is the
fertility of fancy with which each jewel is adorned, that
scarcely any two are exactly identical in ornamentation.
However complicated the system of knotwork, and however
frequently the same form might require filling in,
each workman appears to have been eager to express his
own individuality, and to originate some fresh method
of treatment or new variety of design.</p>

<p>In common with other Teutonic nations, the Anglo-Saxons
were peculiarly fond of personal ornaments.
They held in high esteem both the smith&mdash;the producer
of weapons&mdash;and the goldsmith who manufactured the
rings and bracelets employed as rewards of valour. A
passage in the "Exeter Book," which dilates on the
various stations in life and the capacities required for
them, refers thus to the goldsmith: "For one a wondrous
skill in goldsmith's art is provided: full oft he
decorates and well adorns a powerful king's nobles, and
he to him gives broad land in recompense."</p>

<p>The graves or barrows of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors
have proved singularly prolific in personal ornaments.
Extensive cemeteries have been discovered in the midland,
eastern and southern counties, and particularly
upon the downs of Kent, Sussex, and the Isle of Wight.
The barrows of Kent have revealed personal ornaments
of greater wealth and refinement than those of any
other parts.</p>

<p>The majority of Anglo-Saxon pins were no doubt
employed for fastening up the hair. They often have as
a head the figure of a bird or grotesque animal, ornamented
with garnets, like similar pins from the Continent.
One of the best, which comes from the Faversham
graves in Kent, is in the Gibbs Bequest, now in
the British Museum. It is of silver, formerly gilt;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span>
its upper part is flat and in the form of a bird set with
cut garnets. Gothic tribes had a great predilection for
the bird as a decorative
subject.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A certain number of earrings have been found, but
they are not common. They are generally a ring of
silver wire, plain, or twisted into a spiral form, and
hung sometimes with beads of coloured glass or clay.
The earrings worn by the Franks during the contemporary
Merovingian period are of a type unrepresented
in Anglo-Saxon jewellery. They differ in
size, but are nearly all of the same pattern, and
have a plain hoop. One end is pointed to pierce the
ear, and on the other end is a polygonal metal cube,
each side of which is set with a slice of garnet or
red glass.</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxon necklaces are composed of beads of
many varieties. The commonest, of glass, of numerous
colours and shapes, are very similar to the Roman
beads. Beads of amethystine quartz, probably of
Transylvanian or German origin, and particularly
beads of amber from the Baltic, are found strung on
necklaces, or were hung singly from the neck. When
one remembers the superstitious respect which was
universally paid to precious stones, and especially to
amber, in early times, it is probable that these were
regarded as amulets. The more sumptuous necklaces,
which must have been worn by ladies of rank, are
composed of gold beads or of precious stones in
delicate settings of twisted or beaded gold.</p>

<p>The pendent ornaments hung to the necklaces are
very beautiful. Some are formed of large, finely
coloured garnets cut into triangle or pear shapes and
mounted in gold. Others, generally circular, are
of pure gold worked in interlaced or vermiculated
patterns and set with precious stones. A striking
group of pendants is formed of coins of foreign origin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span>
Roman or Byzantine, or rude copies of them made in
England by Anglo-Saxon goldsmiths. In the British
Museum is an elaborate necklace of glass and terra-cotta
beads with pendent gold coins of the seventh
century, which was found, together with a splendid
brooch, at Sarre, in Kent. Three of the pendants are
coins of Emperors of the East&mdash;Mauricius and
Heraclius&mdash;and the fourth is a coin of Chlotaire II of
France. The central pendant, also circular, is ornamented
with a section from a rod of Roman millefiori
glass set in gold.</p>

<p>Besides coins&mdash;the frequent use of which in late
Roman jewellery has already been noticed&mdash;there
exists a well-known class of personal ornaments
known as <i>nummi bracteati</i>, bracteate coins, and sometimes
as "spangle money." They are thin discs of
metal stamped in a die, so that the design appears in
relief on the face and incuse on the back. They are
generally of gold, have a beaded edging, and are
supplied with loops, also of gold, for suspension.</p>

<p>Fibul&aelig; or brooches are the most numerous of all
Anglo-Saxon ornaments. They are remarkable both
for their beauty and their excellence of workmanship.
Probably more than one was usually worn; and four
or five have been found in the same grave on different
parts of the body. The different types of brooches
from various districts of England are sufficiently
clearly marked to permit their classification as the
ornaments of distinct peoples. For the present
purpose it is convenient to divide them into three
main classes, each class consisting, naturally, of many
varieties. (1) Circular jewelled brooches found among
the remains of the Kentish Saxons, and of the Jutes
of the Isle of Wight. (2) Brooches of the sunk or
concave circular type worn by the Saxons of Berks,
Oxford, and Gloucestershire. (3) Cruciform brooches&mdash;a
type of the elongated form of brooch. They are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span>
peculiar to the Angles who formed the population of
Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria.</p>

<p>(1) The circular jewelled brooches found in the
cemeteries of Kent and sometimes in the Isle of
Wight, but scarcely ever in other parts of England,
may be subdivided again into three classes. The first
of these, and the most numerous, is composed of a
single piece of metal decorated with chased work and
set with jewels. The second group comprises those
formed of a disc of bronze or silver, decorated with
a disc of gold foil covered with inlaid cells forming
triangles and circles, with three bosses grouped round a
central boss. This type is rarer than the first, and is
often of great beauty. The third group, the finest and
rarest, is distinguished by being formed of two plates
of metal joined by a band round the edges, the upper
part being prepared in the cloisonn&eacute; manner for the
reception of stones or pastes, while the pin or <i>acus</i> is
fixed to the lower. Brooches of this type, in which the
stones, mostly garnets, are set upon hatched gold foil
between delicate gold cloisons, represent at its utmost
perfection the process of inlaying already described.
Three of the finest circular jewelled brooches are: the
Kingston brooch in the Mayer Collection at Liverpool,
the Abingdon brooch in the Ashmolean Museum, and
the Sarre brooch in the British Museum. The first,
which is certainly the most beautiful, is 3<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub></span> inches
in diameter. The front is divided into compartments
subdivided into cells of various forms, enriched with
vermicular gold, with turquoises and with garnets laid
upon gold foil. Concentric circles which surround a
central boss are treated alternately in coloured stones
and worked gold.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The Abingdon brooch is divided
into four compartments, each decorated with interlaced
gold wire, and mounted with a boss of ivory, horn or
shell, with a fifth boss in the centre of the brooch. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span>
rest of the ground is decorated with garnets upon
hatched gold foil.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Sarre brooch, 2&#8541; inches in
width, is ornamented in a similar manner, and has a
large central and four smaller bosses composed of a substance
resembling ivory, set with carbuncles<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Pl. XI, 1</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">anglo-saxon and romano-british brooches, etc.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>(2) The next main class of brooches comprises the
concave circular, known also as the cupelliform or
saucer-shaped, found in the West Saxon cemeteries.
They are of bronze or copper, thickly gilt, and very
rarely decorated with jewels. They have a plain edge,
and a centre covered with interlaced and other ornamental
patterns.</p>

<p>(3) Cruciform brooches form the last and most
widely distributed group. They have trefoil or cruciform
tops; but must not be held to have any connection
with Christianity because they approach the
form of a cross, for they are found in purely pagan
graves. Some varieties are found in other parts of England
besides Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria,
but they are rare in Kent. These cruciform Anglian
brooches are of cast bronze, generally gilt, but sometimes
plated with silver. They are often of enormous
size, and covered with rude and elaborate patterns such
as are found upon early Scandinavian objects. Since
the patterns were added after the brooches were cast, it
happens that, though forms are frequently identical,
decorations differ on nearly every specimen. With
the rarest exception, they are never garnished with
precious stones. This kind of brooch appears to have
been evolved about the fourth century.</p>

<p>There are other brooches somewhat of the same form,
but not usually found in England. Amongst these is a
type which, instead of having a trefoil ornament at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span>
top, is square-headed. Though not unknown in France
and Germany, brooches of this design are chiefly
Scandinavian. An important series of both of the
types last mentioned is preserved in the British Museum;
while the fine collection belonging to Sir John Evans
contains many splendid specimens.</p>

<p>Another variety is known as the "radiated" brooch,
from the fact that its upper part, which is rectangular or
semicircular, is ornamented with obtuse rays. The
finest example of this type, and the largest known (it
measures 6&frac14; inches), is in the Bavarian National
Museum at Munich. It dates from about the sixth
century; and was found in a rock tomb near Wittislingen
on the Danube in 1881. It is silver, gilt upon
the upper side, enriched with a cloisonn&eacute; inlay of
garnets in a variety of patterns, and further ornamented
with interlaced gold filigree (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Pl. XII, 7</a>). A Latin inscription
on the under side contains the name <span class="smcap">uffila.</span>
Radiated brooches, which Mr. Roach Smith<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> considers
to be prior in point of date to all other Anglo-Saxon
types, extend over the greater part of Europe. But
they are rare in England, though a few have been found
in Kent and are preserved among the Gibbs Bequest.</p>

<p>There is yet another type of Anglo-Saxon brooch,
annular in shape. It consists of a plain ring, with a
pin travelling round it attached to a small cylinder.
This annular brooch is comparatively rare in Saxon
times. Its interest lies in the fact that it is the parent
of a much more important brooch worn throughout
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>In common with all primitive peoples, the Saxons
held rings in less esteem than other ornaments. The
few that have been found are simple bronze hoops.
Rings were more frequent, however, among the
Merovingians. The chief feature in Merovingian rings,
which are often of gold, is that the bezel is for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span>
most part large and circular. It is either roughly
engraved in the manner of Childeric's signet, or else is
ornamented with cloisonn&eacute; inlay. Other rings have a
high projecting bezel.</p>

<p>Buckles of gold, silver, and bronze, used to fasten
the belt or girdle, or employed on some other part of the
dress, are particularly abundant in Kentish graves.
They vary considerably, many being of particularly
good design, set with garnets and ornamented with
gold filigree. The largest examples can be assigned
to the girdles of men, the smallest and richest to
those of women. Some of the best are in the Gibbs
Bequest.</p>

<p>One of the finest examples of Anglo-Saxon jewellery
is the magnificent gold buckle discovered in
a grave near Taplow, Bucks, and now in the British
Museum. The base of the tongue and the oval ring
are inlaid with glass pastes upon gold foil; while the
buckle plate, enriched with three garnets, is bordered
with many graduated rows of finely twisted gold wire,
and has its centre filled with a sort of vermiculated
pattern upon repouss&eacute; ground (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Pl. XII, 6</a>).</p>

<p>Women's graves have generally yielded a number
of objects of personal use as well as of adornment.
Articles of toilet, such as tweezers, etc., are found by
the side of the skeleton, and resemble the modern
chatelaine. There exist, in addition, curious bronze
pendants sometimes shaped like a pot-hook, which,
found in pairs near the waists of female skeletons,
are known generally as girdle-hangers. Their exact
purpose was for a long time a mystery, but arch&aelig;ologists
are now mostly of the opinion that they were
fastenings for bags or purses suspended from the
girdle.</p>

<p>With the exception of the brooch-pin, which is
always made of iron, Anglo-Saxon jewellery is almost
invariably composed of gold, silver, or of some alloy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span>
and is very rarely of iron like the buckles found in the
Frankish cemeteries. These iron buckles, owing to the
perishable nature of their material are often much disfigured
by rust, but many are sufficiently well preserved
to exhibit a beautiful and elaborate inlay of silver,
sometimes accompanied by gold. Many examples
of them are preserved in the museums of France
and Germany. Some are of extraordinary size. The
buckle and plate alone of one in the museum at Berne
measures no less than 8&#8541; by 4&frac12; inches and half an inch
in thickness. Buckles of this kind have never been
found in England.</p>

<p class="center"><b>LATE ANGLO-SAXON JEWELLERY (SEVENTH TO NINTH CENTURY)</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>FTER the landing of St. Augustine in 597 and
the baptism of Ethelbert, King of Kent, the
conversion of the upper classes in England
appears to have been rapid, and by the third decade of
the seventh century the greater part of the country had
accepted Christianity. Old customs, however, with
regard to burial and the adornment of the corpse, were
slow in disappearing, and even as late as the time of
Charlemagne (742-814) we hear of orders being issued
that the Saxons were no longer to follow the pagan
mode of burial, but to inter their dead in consecrated
ground.</p>

<p>The general abandonment of the custom of burying
ornaments with the dead is responsible for the small
number of the later Anglo-Saxon jewels now extant.
But the few examples surviving from the period which
terminated at the Norman Conquest are of exceptional
merit.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the introduction of
Christianity produced a profound change in the character
of personal ornaments. New forms and methods,
due to closer association with the Continent, were introduced
into the goldsmith's productions by the Church,
which at the same time fostered the splendid traditions
of the older English jewellers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span>
The characteristic of the finest pieces of Saxon
jewellery of the Christian period is their ornamentation
by means of cloisonn&eacute; enamel. It has already been
noticed that Anglo-Saxon jewels were decorated with
gold wires, some twisted or beaded, or rolled up and
plaited together, and soldered on to a thin gold plate;
while others were flattened into strips forming compartments,
which were filled with pieces of garnet or
coloured glass cut to shape. When the spaces between
strips, so disposed as to make up the outlines of figures
or ornament, were filled with enamel paste and fired,
the result was enamel of the cloisonn&eacute; type. This
cloisonn&eacute; enamel naturally resulted as soon as the
Saxon jeweller had mastered the art of fusing vitreous
colours upon metal. From whom did he learn this
art? Was enamelling introduced by the followers of
Augustine from Rome or Byzantium, or did the Irish
missionaries bring afresh into England an art of which
the Celts were past masters? The question is one that
cannot be answered; but it is not without interest to
note the great influence of the Irish craftsmen on the
art productions of the time.</p>

<p>A remarkable development of goldsmiths' work in
Ireland succeeded the introduction of Christianity.
Enamel was largely employed in the decoration of early
objects of ecclesiastical metal-work, and attained perfection
in the translucent cloisonn&eacute; enamel of the Tara
brooch and the Ardagh chalice. The far-reaching influence
and extraordinary activity of the Irish missionaries,
many of them no doubt skilled goldsmiths, are well
known. "Irish missionaries laboured among the Picts
of the Highlands and among the Frisians of the northern
seas. An Irish missionary, Columban, founded monasteries
in Burgundy and the Apennines. The canton
of St. Gall still commemorates in its name another Irish
missionary."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The processes of their artistic metal-work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span>
must have made themselves felt wherever these Irish
missionaries penetrated. The wandering scholars and
artists of Ireland left both their books and their art-apprentices
in England, as they had left them along the
Rhine and the Danube. At Glastonbury, St. Dunstan,
the patron saint of English smiths, lingered as a youth
among the books with which the Irish missionaries had
endowed the monastery, and associated doubtless with
the monastic craftsmen who had learned the arts of
their Celtic predecessors.</p>

<p>Every priest was trained in some handicraft, and
many monks became excellent goldsmiths. St. Dunstan
(924-988), like St. Eloi of France (588-659), at
once a goldsmith and a royal minister, himself worked
in the precious metals; and he appears to have been a
jeweller as well, for we find in old inventories, entries
of finger rings described as the productions of the great
prelate. In the Wardrobe Account of Edward I, in
1299 (<i>Liber Quotidianus</i>, p. 348), is "Unus anulus auri
cum saphiro qui fuit de fabrica Sancti Dunstani ut
credebatur"; and in the inventory of that medi&aelig;val fop,
Piers Gaveston, 1313 (Rymer, <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, II, i. p. 203),
is: "Un anel d'or, &agrave; un saphir, lequel seint Dunstan
forga de ses mayns."</p>

<p>The artistic traditions of the old Saxon jewellers
became almost the sole property of the clergy; and the
Venerable Bede, writing at the commencement of the
eighth century, alluding to the monastic jewellers of his
day, describes how "a skilled gold-worker, wishing to
do some admirable work, collects, wherever he can, remarkable
and precious stones to be placed among the
gold and silver, as well to show his skill as for the
beauty of the work." The description of these stones
as "chiefly of a ruddy or aerial colour" would seem
to indicate that garnets and turquoises had not even
then been entirely supplanted by enamels. Certain it
is that the earlier Christian jewels retained for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span>
time the technique of those of pagan Saxondom. For
example, the gold cross of St. Cuthbert (d. 687), discovered
in his tomb in Durham Cathedral in 1827 and
now preserved in the Cathedral Library, is inlaid with
garnets in the cloisonn&eacute; manner (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 3</a>).</p>

<p>The internecine wars of the Saxons and the early
ravages of the Norsemen, from which England was
delivered by Alfred during the ninth century, can have
left the country little repose for the cultivation of the
jeweller's art. Yet, in spite of the unhappy condition
of England, the art, judging from inscribed jewels
noticed hereafter, was still practised, and needed only
some presiding genius to awaken it to new life.</p>

<p>There is little reason to doubt that jewellery was
among the foremost of the arts which Alfred is known
to have encouraged; indeed, his interest in such work
is asserted by a well-sustained tradition. And if the
world-famed jewel to be described is, as seems probable,
to be associated with Alfred of Wessex, he must
then have personally supervised the production of other
contemporary jewels. The Alfred jewel, the finest example
left of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship, and the most
famous of all English jewels, is preserved in the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford. It was found in 1693
at Newton (or Petherton) Park, three miles from the
Isle of Athelney, Somerset, whither Alfred had fled
from the Danes in the year 878, and was presented to
the museum in 1718 by Thomas Palmer, grandson of
Colonel Nathaniel Palmer, near whose estate it was
found. The jewel is 2 inches long, 1&#8533; wide, and half an
inch in thickness. It somewhat resembles a battledore
in shape; it is flat front and back, while the other parts
of its surface are rounded. The obverse is of rock
crystal, beneath which is a plaque of semi-transparent
cloisonn&eacute; enamel of blue, white, green, and brown,
representing the figure of a man. Upon the reverse
is an engraved gold plate. The smaller end of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span>
oval is prolonged into the form of a boar's head, from
the snout of which projects a hollow socket. Around
the sloping sides of the jewel, from left to right, runs
the legend <span class="smcap">aelfred mec heht gewyrcan</span> (<i>Alfred
ordered me to be made</i>), in gold letters, exquisitely
chiselled in open-work upon the band which encircles
the enamel and its crystal covering. The whole of the
goldwork is beautifully executed in filigree and granulation
(<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 1, 2</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There is considerable doubt as to the actual use of
this precious jewel. Professor Earle has placed it
among the category of personal ornaments, and holds
that it was executed under the personal supervision of
Alfred the Great, and formed the central ornament of
his helmet or crown.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The enamelled figure is probably
intended for that of Christ, represented, as is frequently
done in early ecclesiastical art, holding two sceptres.
The gold setting of the jewel, it is generally agreed,
was made in England, and in the opinion of many the
enamel is of native origin.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Somewhat similar in shape to the Alfred jewel, and
probably employed for the same purpose, is a jewel
known as the Minster Lovel jewel, which was found
half a century ago in a village of that name near
Oxford, and is now preserved in the Ashmolean
Museum. It is 1&frac14; inches in length, circular above,
with a projecting socket below. The upper part is
ornamented with a cross-shaped design in cloisonn&eacute;
enamel.</p>

<p>Another remarkable jewel, preserved in the British
Museum, is termed the Dowgate brooch, or the Roach
Smith nouche (or brooch), in memory of the learned
and energetic antiquary whose property it once was.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span>
The brooch was found near Dowgate Hill in Thames
Street, London, in 1839. It is composed of a circular
enamel representing a full-faced head and bust, enclosed
in a border of rich gold filigree covered with beaded
ornament and set at equal distances with four pearls.
The fine cloisons of the enamel work are arranged so
as to mark the outlines of the face, a crown upon the
head, and the folds of the drapery of a mantle or tunic.
The dress is classical in appearance, and seems to be
fastened on the right shoulder<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 4</a>).</p>

<p>Two other enamelled brooches of the same kind of
workmanship, also in the British Museum, are the
Townley brooch, also known as the Hamilton brooch,
which is said to have been found in Scotland, and the
Castellani brooch, formerly in the collection of Signor
Castellani, and stated to have been found at Canosa,
Italy (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Pl. IX, 9, 11</a>).</p>

<p>The latter brooch is set with a circular enamel
representing the bust of a royal personage wearing
large earrings, and upon the front of the dress a circular
brooch with three pendants hanging below it. At the
lower part of the gold and enamel frame of the Castellani
brooch itself are three loops, which must have held
pendants exactly similar to those attached to the brooch
worn by the enamelled figure. Pendants of this kind
are represented, as has been seen, on the Ravenna
mosaics, and appear to be characteristic of Byzantine
brooches. And it is probable that this, as well as the
Townley brooch, as explained in the <i>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries</i> (2nd Series, Vol. XX, p. 64), is
of Continental origin.</p>

<p>Though similar in some respects to the other enamelled
jewels, these two brooches differ considerably
from them. "These differences," says a recent writer,
"seem to accentuate the difficulty of tracing the origin
of this enamelled work. It may well be that some of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span>
it was executed in this country by the craftsmen in the
employ of King Alfred; but it may fairly be assumed
that on the journeys to Rome and elsewhere, undertaken
by Ethelwulf, Alfred, and Ethelswitha, they and
their suites would acquire jewellery of this class, which
must have been comparatively common in Rome, and
in other important centres at that time."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The rings dating from the time of pagan Saxondom
are few and unimportant; those, on the other
hand, that belong to this later period, though rare, are
more numerous, and are of considerable historical and
artistic interest. It is somewhat curious that the finest
date almost exclusively from the ninth century, and
that most of them are inscribed. It is to this fact,
doubtless, that they owe their preservation.</p>

<p>No Anglo-Saxon rings, as far as we are aware, are
ornamented with enamel. Many are enriched with
inlays of niello. Gold rings thus inlaid sometimes
have the appearance of having been enamelled, for the
niello seems to have a bluish tinge, but this may be
due, as Mr. Davenport suggests (<i>Anglo-Saxon Review</i>,
Vol. V), to some optical effect caused by the yellow
gold.</p>

<p>The most important inscribed Saxon rings, three in
number, are historical relics of the highest order.
They belonged respectively to Alhstan, Bishop of
Sherborne (824-867); Ethelwulf, King of Wessex
(836-858), father of Alfred the Great; and Ethelswith,
Queen of Mercia, and sister to King Alfred.</p>

<p>The ring of Alhstan, at once the earliest episcopal
finger ring and the first in chronological order of these
inscribed gold rings, was found in 1753 at Llys-f&aelig;n, in
the county of Carnarvonshire. It was one of the chief
treasures of the famous collection of finger rings
formed by the late Edmund Waterton, and is now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span>
in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The initials of
its owner are inscribed in niello upon four circular
compartments, separated by four lozenge-shaped compartments
also inlaid with niello (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 9</a>).</p>

<p>The most famous of all English rings&mdash;"une pi&egrave;ce
excessivement pr&eacute;cieuse," says M. Fontenay, "par son
originalit&eacute; et son caract&egrave;re"&mdash;is that of Ethelwulf,
King of Wessex. It is in the form of a bishop's mitre
with only one peak, and bears the inscription
<img src="images/ethelvvlf.png" width="95" height="14" alt="inscriptio" title="" />
above which are two peacocks pecking at a tree.
The legend and subject are reserved in gold upon a
nielloed ground. The ring was picked up in its
present bent condition in 1780 by a labourer in a field
at Laverstoke, near Salisbury, where it had been
pressed out of a cart-rut. It is now in the British
Museum (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 5</a>).</p>

<p>The third of this remarkable series of inscribed
rings is that of Ethelswith, Queen of Mercia, daughter
of Ethelwulf. It has a circular bezel, in the middle of
which is a rude representation of an <i>Agnus Dei</i> engraved
in relief with a background of niello. The
inner side of the bezel is incised with the inscription
<img src="images/cross.png" width="15" height="15" alt="" title="" />
<span class="smcap">eathelsvith regna.</span> This beautiful ring was
found near Aberford, in Yorkshire, about the year 1870,
and came into the possession of Sir A. W. Franks,
who bequeathed it to the British Museum (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 7</a>).</p>

<p>Several other Saxon rings are preserved in the
British Museum. Among them is one with a plain
hoop and beaded edges, bearing around it in gold
letters on a nielloed ground an inscription recording
the name of the owner, Ethred, and the maker Eanred.
It was found in Lancashire, and bequeathed to the
museum by Sir Hans Sloane in 1753. Another ring
(found near Peterborough in the River Nene) is peculiar
for having two bezels opposite each other. Both sides
of the hoop and each bezel are engraved with interlaced
designs inlaid with niello. The bezels are each flanked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span>
by three small beads of gold&mdash;a characteristic ornamentation
of a certain class of Teutonic and Merovingian
rings, termed by the French <i>bagues &agrave; trois
grains</i>. In the Victoria and Albert Museum is a silver
ring of unusual form. It has an oval bezel 1&frac14; inches
in length, engraved with convoluted ornament in five
divisions, the centre being filled with a serpent-headed
monster. It was found in the Thames at Chelsea in
1856. A type of ring which occurs more than once
is formed of a hoop, which widens gradually into a
large oval bezel ornamented with bands of rich plaited
goldwork. One of these rings, found at Bossington,
near Stockbridge, is in the Ashmolean Museum. It
has in the centre a male portrait surrounded by the
inscription, <span class="smcap">nomen ehlla fid in xpo</span> (My name is
Ella; my faith is in Christ).</p>

<p>More remarkable, perhaps, than any of the above,
on account of the peculiar beauty of its workmanship,
is a gold ring in the possession of Lord Fitzhardinge,
and preserved, together with the Hunsdon jewels,
at Berkeley Castle. It has a large bezel of quatrefoil
form. In the centre is a raised circular boss
ornamented with a cross or wheel-shaped design in
beaded gold. Radiating from this centre are four
heads of monsters, inlaid with thin lines of niello,
and having projecting eyes formed of dots of dark blue
and dark brown glass or enamel. The hoop of the
ring, of considerable girth, is hexagonal in section.
At the junction of its ends at the back of the bezel,
immediately behind the monsters' ears, it is finished
with a graduated wire of filigree, terminating with three
small balls. The ring dates from about the tenth century.
Nothing is known concerning its discovery. It is
probably Saxon, but may be of Irish origin (<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Pl. XIII, 10</a>).</p>

<p>Beyond these finger rings and the enamelled jewellery,
we possess few other examples of later Saxon
ornaments; yet there exist a small number, which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span>
though executed somewhat after the manner of the
older jewels, probably belong to this later period
of Saxon art. Among such ornaments is a necklace
from Desborough, Northants, and now in the British
Museum. It is formed of beads of spirally coiled
gold wire. Circular pendants, having one side convex
and the other flat, alternate with gold pendants of
various shapes and sizes, set with garnets. From the
centre of the necklace hangs a cross (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Pl. XII, 1</a>).</p>

<p>One other ornament in the British Museum, particularly
worthy of attention, is a beautiful set of three
ornamental pins of silver gilt, which were found in the
River Witham, near Lincoln. The three pins have
heads in the shape of circular discs, and are connected
together by two oblong pieces of metal with a ring at
each end. The pins average four inches in length.
The interlaced ornament on their circular heads (described
in detail in the <i>Reliquary</i>, 2nd Series, Vol. X,
p. 52), is arranged in four panels separated by radial
divisions.</p>

<p>The penannular brooch, known as the Celtic brooch,
so common in other parts of the British Isles about
this period, has rarely been found in England. A few
examples occur in close proximity to undoubted Anglo-Saxon
remains, but they are confined mostly to the
north of England. Its extreme rarity leads one naturally
to the conclusion that it found but little favour in England.
In Scotland and Ireland, however, where it was
almost universally worn, this type of brooch attained,
as will shortly be shown, the highest degree of excellence
both in design and workmanship.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE CELTIC BROOCH</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>N order to understand the condition of the arts in
the more remote parts of the British Isles, subsequent
to the introduction of Christianity towards
the middle of the fifth century, one must remember the
situation created by the invasions of the Teutonic tribes,
whereby nearly the whole of northern and western
Europe relapsed into paganism, while Ireland and the
western highlands of Scotland alone remained faithful
to the Christian Church. During the earlier centuries
of this period, the designs and processes of the Celtic
crafts, nurtured in these parts of the British Isles by the
Church, undisturbed by invaders, and free from outside
influences, were brought to a state of high perfection.</p>

<p>The introduction of Christianity into Ireland by St.
Patrick, who doubtless brought with him European
craftsmen, had greatly encouraged the production of
metal-work; and though changes in design resulted, the
spiral patterns characteristic of Celtic art were retained
for a considerable length of time&mdash;longer in fact than in
any other quarters. It is unfortunate, however, that
while a number of objects of early Christian art from
Ireland and the Scottish highlands have survived,
there is scarcely a single article of jewellery which is
prior in date to about the ninth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>The chief personal ornaments belonging to this later
period, i.e. the ninth century onwards, are a number of
remarkable objects known as Celtic brooches. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span>
Celtic brooch, as far as its origin and development are
concerned, shows no kinship with the bow or disc-shaped
brooches already described, though, like them, it
probably originated among the primitive Celts of the
Danubian region. One theory derives its evolution
from what is known as a ring-pin, that is a simple pin,
the head of which, primarily solid, was afterwards
pierced and fitted with a ring, which in course of time
increased in size and became highly ornamented.
Another theory traces the Celtic brooch from a combination
of a long pin with the ancient dress fasteners&mdash;penannular
rings furnished with knobs&mdash;such as are
found in prehistoric graves, and are even now worn by
the natives of West Africa. This penannular brooch
has been found not only in Scotland and Ireland, but as
far east as Livonia, and is actually still in use in
Algeria at the present day. Its peculiarity consists in
the great size of its pin&mdash;one in the British Museum
measures 22&frac12; inches&mdash;the length of the pin being
supposed to have corresponded to the rank of its owner.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
In some of the earlier forms the ring is of the same
breadth all round, and merely cut across in one place
for the passage of the pin. But as a rule this penannular
ring terminates in knobs, and when the pin
which travels round the ring has pierced the portions
of the garments it is intended to unite, the ring is
pushed a little to one side and prevented by the terminal
knobs from becoming unloosened.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The developments in the form of this brooch show
its evolution from a penannular to an annular ring. In
some&mdash;probably the earliest&mdash;examples, the ring and the
head of the pin terminate in bulbous knobs, or in
spherical ends ornamented with Celtic designs and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span>
animals' heads. In others the ends of the rings and
the pin-heads are broadened, in order to provide space
for an elaborate surface decoration of interlaced work
and zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs similar
to those upon the Irish manuscripts. Finally, the opening
is closed and the ring becomes annular.</p>

<p>The finest examples of these brooches are preserved
in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin,
the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland in
Edinburgh, and the British Museum. Among the
earliest&mdash;which are not, however, prior to the later
Anglo-Saxon period, and make their appearance about
the ninth century&mdash;are those with a plain penannular
ring, formed of a solid cylindrical rod of silver, terminating
with bulbous knobs furnished with expansions,
and often covered with a peculiar prickly
ornamentation like thistle-heads. Specimens of this
style of brooch have been found in Ireland, Scotland,
and in the north of England.</p>

<p>The simplest of the silver penannular brooches
with discoidal terminations in the museum at Edinburgh
is one from Croy in Inverness-shire. It has
ends expanding into circular discs with amber settings.
The most elaborate, one of two known as the
Cadboll brooches, found at Rogart in Sutherlandshire,
has four raised heads of birds, two upon the
circumference of each disc, and two upon the ring.
The collection in the Royal Irish Academy contains
several splendid brooches of a similar type, notably
the Kilmainham brooch from Kilmainham, Co. Dublin,
the surface of which is ornamented with compartments
of thin plates of gold tooled with interlaced patterns.</p>

<p>The terminations of the penannular ring soon become
so expanded that they fill up exactly half the ring.
Upon these flattened plaques, which have just space
enough between them for the pin to pass, a serpent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span>
or dragon form is a frequent ornament, as well as the
intertwined triple ornament, or <i>triquetra</i>, while the surface
is set at intervals with bosses of amber. The most
remarkable examples of this type are the University
brooch in the collection of Trinity College, Dublin, and
the Clarendon brooch found in Co. Kilkenny, and now
in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy.</p>

<p>The main characteristic of the Celtic brooch is that
it is penannular, that is, its ring has an opening, if not
real, at least apparent, between its two ends. For even
when the narrow opening left between the enlarged
ends is closed by a bar, or is finally closed altogether,
the flattened plaques are ornamentally treated as if they
were still disunited. Of this class of brooches with
continuous rings there have survived two world-famed
examples, one from Ireland and the other from Scotland.
The first of these, known as the Tara brooch, was found
in 1850 on the seashore near Bettystown, Co. Louth,
and received the title of "Tara" on account of its
beauty, and after the celebrated hill of that name. It
is composed of white bronze thickly gilded. The ring
and expanded head of the pin are divided into a
number of panels ornamented with examples of nearly
every technical process, being enriched with enamel-work,
niello, and inlaid stones; while the metal is
hammered, chased, and engraved, and filigreed with
extraordinary delicacy. The enamels, of the cloisonn&eacute;
kind, have been made separately and mounted like
gems. Attached to the brooch on one side is a finely
plaited chain; a similar chain upon the other side has
been lost. The reverse of the brooch is unadorned with
settings, but decorated with a divergent spiral ornament
known as the Celtic trumpet pattern, executed with very
great perfection. The probable date of this extraordinary
jewel is the tenth century. It is now the chief
treasure of the museum of the Royal Irish Academy,
for which it was bought in 1867 for the sum of &pound;200.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span></p><p>The finest after the Tara brooch, and the most
famous of Scottish brooches, is known as the Hunterston
brooch. It was found in 1826 on the estate of Mr.
Robert Hunter, of West Kilbride, Ayrshire, and is now
in the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland.
It is somewhat similar to the Tara brooch, and of the
same gilt metal, but rather less ornate, and unprovided
with enamels, glass pastes, or chain. Its main ornamentation
consists of varieties of interlaced work in
fine gold filigree, of singularly beautiful design and of
remarkable execution. The back is decorated with the
trumpet pattern, and engraved with Runic characters.</p>

<p>The presence of the trumpet pattern upon the backs
of these two famous brooches determines their date as
prior to the eleventh century; for the old Celtic pattern
disappears from brooches and from most Irish and
all Scottish metal-work after the year 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and is
succeeded by varieties of interlaced work and zoomorphic
designs.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The later Celtic brooches differ besides in
form, for the pin is longer in proportion to the size
of the ring, and its head is hinged upon a constriction
of the ring, which itself becomes partly filled up.</p>

<p>The Celtic brooch is distinct in itself, and does not
merge into any other form. It disappears entirely
about the thirteenth century, and is succeeded by a
totally different type of brooch, which belongs to the
ornaments of the later Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>O the student of jewellery the Middle Ages offer
far greater problems than the periods of classic
antiquity. The main reason for this is to be
found in the fact that throughout medi&aelig;val and
later periods ornaments were more closely associated
with dress, and dress itself became subject to the most
marked changes and constant divergences of fashion.
In the days of antiquity, so far as our knowledge goes,
the idea of fashion, in the present sense of the term,
did not exist. But in the Middle Ages, as Luthmer
points out, it becomes an important factor in the history
of civilisation. The duration of each prevalent fashion
tended to become shorter and shorter, and the new
mode was usually an absolute contrast to the preceding
one. Though ornaments, owing to their higher
material value, did not alter with each successive
change in dress, nevertheless they underwent rapid
variations of style.</p>

<p>The custom of burying objects in graves, which
continued for a considerable time after the introduction
of Christianity, affords a tolerably clear idea of the
various ornaments worn during the earlier periods of
the Middle Ages. Coming to a later period, from the
time of the first Crusade onwards, discoveries in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span>
graves are extremely rare, and one has to look in many
directions for information respecting the articles then
in use. Though there seems to have been an immense
production of personal ornaments throughout the whole
of Europe, their intrinsic value has been too great to
allow of their preservation; and the artistic qualities
of those that have survived cause one to regret all the
more the wholesale destruction that must have occurred.
The jewels of the period are, in fact, so few in number,
and furnish such striking varieties, that it is impossible
to give an exhaustive synopsis of the different changes
that took place in their form. The utmost that can be
attempted is to take single characteristic pieces and
allow them to stand as types of the whole epoch.</p>

<p>Personal ornaments at this time began to have a
wider significance than that of being merely decorations
pleasant to the eye. Their material value comes
more in the foreground. They began to form the
nucleus of family and household treasures. The uncertain
conditions of life made it desirable for the
individual to have his most precious possessions in a
portable form. An unfortunate war or royal displeasure
might cost a prince or baron his land or his
castles; but his movable goods, consisting of precious
stones and gold and silver ornaments, were not so
easily exposed to the vagaries of his superiors. Thus
the numerous inventories of household goods that
have come down from those times show an astounding
increase in the matter of jewels and treasures among
the great and lesser grandees, both secular and ecclesiastical;
while there is a corresponding advance at the
same time in craftsmanship. To this change in the
significance of ornaments is to be attributed their rarity
in graves. Jewellery had, in fact, assumed the character
of money passed from hand to hand, and was constantly,
so to speak, recoined; for even if held in
steadfast possession it had to submit to changes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span>
fashion and undergo frequent resetting.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Particularly
was this the case at the period of the Renaissance, when
almost everything Gothic was remodelled.</p>

<p>Tombs, then, supply little or no information; and
for the present purpose one may make shift to use the
chance descriptions of romancers, and such pictorial
representations of jewellery as are presented by effigies
on brasses, tombstones, and other monumental sculpture,
and also by illuminated manuscripts. Monumental
effigies show a number of accurately executed
personal ornaments, which, belonging as they do mainly
to sovereigns and individuals of wealth and distinction,
may be taken as the highest types of those then
worn. The miniatures and decorations of manuscripts
executed towards the end of the period under review
also afford considerable assistance; for illuminators were
intensely fond of introducing jewels among the plants,
flowers, birds, and butterflies minutely depicted on ornamental
borders. The inventories of personal effects made
for various purposes, and often full of graphic details,
throughout the whole of the period supply absolutely
trustworthy evidence as to contemporary ornaments.
Pictures, which are among the chief sources of information,
are not at one's disposal until towards the termination
of this epoch, but such as were produced during
the later Gothic style, particularly in Italy, Germany,
and the Low Countries, furnish numerous examples of
jewellery painted with loving care and minute detail.</p>

<p>Even from these sources of information, however,
one could form but an inadequate idea of the precise
character of medi&aelig;val jewellery. But, while the various
reasons mentioned have resulted in the general destruction
of articles made for secular use, among precious
objects consecrated to religious uses a small number of
personal ornaments have been preserved. This may
be due, perhaps, to the sanctity of the places containing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span>
them, or perhaps to the precautions of their guardians,
who have hidden them in time of trouble. They have
survived many and strange vicissitudes, and their
safety is now secured by a new-created arch&aelig;ological
value, in place of the religious devotion which was
their former guardian. In the treasury&mdash;an edifice
attached to the church&mdash;there was kept in early times,
among the vestments and plate used in its services,
a vast collection of reliquaries and jewels gradually
brought together, and preserved as memorials of the
piety of the faithful. In numerous cases the treasury
must have constituted a veritable museum, exhibiting
examples of jewellery of each successive style. Some
idea can be formed of the immense scope, as well as of
the magnificence of its contents, from the early inventories
which arch&aelig;ologists of recent years have taken
pains to gather together and publish.</p>

<p>The relative abundance of jewellery of Merovingian
and Frankish times, and the great rarity of jewellery
from the ninth century onwards, are phenomena observable
in every museum. The reason for this lies in the
fact that until the time of Charlemagne (742-814) the
dead were buried with their weapons and with every
article of jewellery. The Emperor forbade this mainly
as a heathen practice, but largely because he saw the
disadvantage of so many costly objects being withdrawn
from circulation, with consequent loss to the
national resources.</p>

<p>This almost complete absence of examples renders
it difficult to estimate precisely the style of ornaments
then in use. But as far as can be judged, Byzantine
influence seems to have affected all forms of jewellery.
It is known, at all events, that until about the twelfth
century active commercial transactions between France
and Germany on the one hand, and Byzantium on the
other, were carried on by way of Venice. Not only
did Byzantine workmen settle in the great seaport of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span>
the Adriatic, but imitations of work from the Eastern
Roman provinces were probably made there at an early
date by native artists. Such traffic appears to have
been particularly active during the Carlovingian period;
while the close friendship of Charlemagne with Haroun
al-Raschid, the celebrated caliph of the Saracens,
renders it further probable that models of Oriental art
abounded in the West in the ninth century. These
were not merely confined to articles of jewellery and
other goldsmith's productions, but included also
sumptuous dress materials interwoven with threads of
gold, embroideries studded with gems and pearls, and
other objects which the splendour of the rulers of the
West and the princes of the Church borrowed from
the magnificence prevalent in the East and at the Byzantine
Court.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Eastern influence which during the fourth and
fifth centuries had come westwards by way of Byzantium,
and had acquired new power owing to the sovereignty
of the Arabs in Spain and Sicily during the
eighth and ninth centuries, increased considerably at
the time of the Crusades. The knights and princes
of the West brought back not only impressions of
culture from Syria and Palestine, but also actual specimens
of gold ornaments and precious stones. There
then began an invasion of skilled workmen from the
towns of Asia Minor, and a regular importation of such
treasures by the merchants of the Italian republics, to
wit, Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, who, under the banner of
the Cross, re-established their trade with the East.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Until about the twelfth century ornaments followed
for the most part the style of those in use in the
Eastern Roman provinces. Some were adorned with
cloisonn&eacute; enamel introduced from Byzantium, and
first executed by Continental workmen about the eighth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span>
century. Cloisonn&eacute;, however, was, in turn, abandoned
for champlev&eacute; enamel, the manufacture of which upon
the Lower Rhine had been encouraged by the Church,
through the instrumentality of the Greek monks.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the twelfth century, the West
seems to have become lastingly independent of the
East, even with regard to its ornaments, as may be
inferred from various remarkable productions in gold
and silver, and particularly in gilded copper adorned
with champlev&eacute; enamel, such as shrines and other
sacred objects. Many of these are still preserved in the
ecclesiastical treasuries of Germany, while museums at
home and abroad all possess beautiful examples.</p>

<p>Though the personal ornaments of this period are
now almost entirely lost to us in the original, there
has yet been preserved a treasure of inestimable value
in the form of a technological manual handed down
from the Middle Ages. The work referred to is the
famous treatise of Theophilus entitled <i>Schedula Diversarum
Artium</i>, which describes the technical processes
of almost all the industrial arts cultivated eight centuries
ago&mdash;the treatise being written shortly before the
year 1100.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> After describing his workshop, Theophilus
mentions his tools, and proceeds to describe minutely
the various processes necessary for the metal-worker
to understand; and shows how the goldsmith was
required to be at the same time a modeller, sculptor,
smelter, enameller, jewel-mounter, and inlay-worker.
Altogether, to judge from the directions there given,
more especially those relating to the technical work
of the goldsmiths, these <i>Schedul&aelig;</i> would seem to reflect
the ancient knowledge and practices of Byzantine workmen,
of which, however, the goldsmiths of the twelfth
century appear to have become completely independent.</p>

<p>The perfection of artistic work attained by the
monasteries led to the production of sumptuous objects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span>
to meet the requirements of the Church in connection
with its services, while costly shrines were made to
contain the numerous relics brought home by pilgrims
from the Holy Land. During the period of the
Romanesque and early Gothic styles personal ornaments
became objects of lesser importance than articles for
ecclesiastical use.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The enamel-work for the decoration
of ornaments was mostly executed at Limoges,
which was then rising to importance as the chief centre
for the production of enamels. The process employed
was champlev&eacute;, generally upon copper. Such ornaments
as buckles, and brooches or morses, for the belts
of knights or the vestments of ecclesiastics, were produced
in considerable numbers at Limoges, and found
their way all over the north-west of Europe. The
trade-guilds of Limoges were probably more active in
this kind of enamel than those situated upon the banks
of the Rhine, whose work seems to have been devoted
principally to shrines and objects for the use of the
Church. Ornaments of the above types were executed
during the greater part of the twelfth century and
throughout the thirteenth, but their manufacture ceased
in the century following, when Limoges was sacked by
the Black Prince.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the thirteenth century a
change takes place with the appearance of the Gothic
style. Forms become slighter and more elegant, and
exhibit greater delicacy and detail in their workmanship.
Hitherto goldsmith's work, however beautiful
from the cumulative effect of precious stones and
enamels, was little more than conventional, nay, almost
barbaric, in its representations of the human figure; but
the revival in the art of figure sculpture led to a considerable
use being made of the human figure executed
in full relief. Just as in the Romanesque period, so
during the time when Gothic art reigned supreme,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span>
architecture left its impress on every work of art; and
jewellery and other goldsmith's work, as well as ivories,
seals, and even shoes, were ornamented with the
designs of Gothic architecture and with pierced open-work
patterns, like the window tracery of the great
cathedrals&mdash;termed "Paul's windows" by the masses.
Improved skill in design and workmanship became
incompatible with the retention of the older and coarser
enamel-work, and without relinquishing a medium
which by the brilliancy of its colouring was eminently
suited to the works of the goldsmith, the thirteenth-century
craftsman obtained the desired result by the
use of translucent enamel upon metal, usually silver,
chased and modelled in low relief.</p>

<p>The beauty of this <i>basse-taille</i> enamel, producing,
as it were, transparent pictures, enabled the artist
frequently to dispense with coloured gems, and retain
only pearls, whose delicate hues harmonised better with
his work. Occasionally, however, pearls, precious
stones, and translucent enamels were employed together
with brilliant effect.</p>

<p>Gothic ornaments of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries show a peculiar love for figurative and architectural
motives which exhibit astonishing technique
and beauty of form. Towards the middle of the fourteenth
century there came into use enamel on full relief
(<i>&eacute;mail en ronde bosse</i>). In the inventories of the time,
where it is frequently mentioned, this enamel, usually
opaque white, is termed <i>&eacute;mail en blanc</i>. So charming
was the contrast of white, marble-like figures by the side
of gold, bright coloured stones, and polychrome enamels,
that for upwards of three centuries goldsmiths continued
to apply this species of enamel to jewels. It was particularly
characteristic of the fifteenth century. Several
brooches ornamented with it will be referred to later
(p. 143); but the most remarkable example of its use
is the wonderful votive jewel of French workmanship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span>
termed "Das Goldene R&ouml;ssel," in the treasury of the
abbey church of Altoetting, in Bavaria, which dates
from about 1400.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The minute repouss&eacute; figures on
sixteenth-century jewels were usually coated with white
enamel; and jewellery <i>&eacute;maill&eacute;e de blanc</i>
is often alluded
to in inventories. This species of enamel was discarded
in the seventeenth century, when figures in relief
went out of fashion for jewellery.</p>

<p>Though towards the close of the Middle Ages the
art of cutting precious stones and even diamonds was
certainly practised, yet it is to be observed that
throughout the whole period jewellery is set as a rule
with stones <i>en cabochon</i>, i.e. with their surfaces rounded
and polished in a convex shape, but not faceted. The
stone treated thus preserves its own character and
individuality; and much of the charm of early jewellery
is due to this very fact.</p>

<p>From the middle of the thirteenth century enamel
in general, though applied to jewels of commoner kinds,
is chiefly limited to the more sumptuous ornaments of
the clergy. But with the beginning of the fourteenth
century the delight in jewellery enriched with enamels
and precious stones is again revealed in the costumes
of the laity. At the French Court of John II (<i>le Bon</i>,
d. 1364) and Charles V (d. 1380), where the princes
of the royal blood strove to outrival one another in
luxurious display, personal adornments attained an
extraordinary degree of splendour, and were worn to an
excess of ostentation.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>This extravagance of fashion declined for a time
owing to the wars with England, but attained its full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span>
development in the dress of the Burgundian Court.
The splendour of the Burgundian dukes, outshining
that of their feudal lieges the kings of France, and
casting into the shade the rude grandeur of the German
emperors, gave a new impetus to the use of articles for
personal decoration, and for a time set the fashion for
every country of northern Europe in all matters of
style as well as of ornament. Outside of Italy, which
perhaps excelled in point of culture, the Court of the
dukes of Burgundy during the fifteenth century was
the richest and most luxurious in all Europe. The
sway of this powerful House extended over the Low
Countries, whose ports after Venice were the centres of
Oriental commerce and whose inland towns, such as
Arras, Brussels, and Ghent, vied with one another in
weaving the products of the East into all manner of
rich stuffs. Not only silks, but pearls and precious
stones of all descriptions, found an entrance through the
great port of Bruges; and hardly a garment is depicted
by the Flemish masters which, particularly in the case
of the ecclesiastics, is not thick-sewn with Oriental
pearls and stones. A survey of records containing
descriptions of personal property,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and an examination
of contemporary pictures&mdash;always the most fascinating
document in regard to personal ornament&mdash;reveal a
widespread luxury. Not only at Court, but in the
everyday life of street and mart, costumes formed of
magnificent stuffs were habitually worn, which required
to be set off by jewels of an equally rich description.
The warmth of the Italian climate demanded no such
wealth of apparel as was essential to comfort in the
more northerly countries; hence profusion of personal
ornament was less generally indulged in throughout
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span>
Italy during the same period. This special love of
jewellery and consequent taste and skill acquired by
the goldsmiths was shared by the painters of the day.
With a high degree of finish and brilliancy, they
introduced into their pictures faithful representations
of all the rich ornaments then in vogue. Unfortunately
actual examples of the splendid jewels of this time are
now of the utmost rarity, but such as have survived,
chiefly in the form of rich enamelled brooches, reflect
in their execution the technical perfection and in their
design the whole-hearted realism which display themselves
to the full in the paintings of the early Flemish school.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span> FEW brooches and finger rings are almost the
only surviving examples of English jewellery of
the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries. Yet there
is evidence from existing records of an abundance
of the most beautiful objects as accumulated in the
ecclesiastical treasuries, and the great shrines, like that
of St. Thomas of Canterbury, or of Our Lady of Walsingham
Priory, which not even the Santa Casa at
Loreto, or the shrine of St. James at Compostella,
could surpass in renown, or equal in the reception of
rich and costly gifts. Vast quantities of jewelled objects,
which must have been in great part native productions,
have also been tabulated in the inventories of
our monarchs, princes, guilds, and corporations. Judging
from extant examples of English painted glass,
sculpture, and particularly embroidery, some estimate
can be formed of the high quality of the goldsmiths'
work, which was scarcely excelled in the Middle Ages
by that of any other country in Europe. The English
goldsmiths, in fact, after the Norman Conquest seem
to have lost none of the skill which is displayed on
their earlier productions.</p>

<p>A love of finery seems to have characterised the
Court of William the Conqueror and his successors.
The jewellery of the ladies became exceedingly extravagant,
and is bitterly inveighed against by the religious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span>
satirists. Neckam, an Anglo-Latin poet, towards the
close of the twelfth century, accuses them of covering
themselves with gold and gems and of perforating their
ears in order to hang them with jewels.</p>

<p>Henry I had the tastes of a collector. That he
collected gems is known from a letter written by a
prior of Worcester to Edmer, Anselm's biographer, in
which he suggests that for money Henry might be
persuaded to part with some pearls.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> King John was
greatly attached to his jewels, and their loss in the
Wash is commonly supposed to have hastened his
death. The record is preserved concerning the loss on
an earlier occasion of certain of his precious stones
"which we are wont to wear round our neck." The
stones must have been credited with miraculous powers,
for their finder was very liberally rewarded.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Henry III,
one of the most indigent of monarchs, made such extravagant
presents of jewellery to his wife, that he
was afterwards obliged to pawn not only his regalia,
but a considerable portion of the jewels and precious
stones accumulated at the shrine of Edward the Confessor
at Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Dating first from about this period are a number of
inventories of personal ornaments; and it is by a perusal
of the inventories of the most wealthy, and particularly
those of sovereign princes, that an estimate can be obtained
of the nature of every type of ornament in use
at the period, in its most elaborate form. Among the
earliest and most important royal inventories that have
been published are those preserved in the Wardrobe
Account (<i>Liber Quotidianus</i>) of Edward I, for the year
1299.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The jewels (<i>jocalia</i>) include a large number of

objects offered by the king or queen to various shrines;
while among other jewels are brooches or nouches (nouche&aelig;),
many rings (<i>anuli</i>), a pendant (<i>pendulum</i>), belt
(<i>zona</i>), bracelet (<i>braccale</i>), and baldrick (<i>baudre</i>). About
this time masses of precious stones, the spoils of the
Crusades, began to find their way into this country, and
to be employed for "broidering" or sewing upon the
garments. Edward II and his extravagant favourites,
such as the worthless Piers Gaveston, loaded themselves
with precious stones. Lists of jewels belonging
to Gaveston on his attainder in 1313,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and to the king
in 1324, show the magnificence of their ornaments, and
the vast sums at which they were valued. The king's
jewels,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> described in considerable detail, are inventoried
under the following headings: (<i>a</i>) Stones and other
objects, (<i>b</i>) Crowns of gold and silver, including <i>cercles</i>
and <i>chapeletz</i>, (<i>c</i>) Brooches (<i>fermails</i>) of gold, (<i>d</i>) <i>Fleures
de liz</i>, (<i>e</i>) Rings (<i>anelx</i>) of gold, (<i>f</i>) Girdles (<i>ceintres</i>)
and diadems (<i>tressoures</i>). From this time onward there
is an increase of such documents and of wills, and also
of sumptuary laws specially connected with personal
ornaments.</p>

<p>The brilliant reign of Edward III<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was favourable
to the full display of jewellery. New luxuries were
imported in great abundance, and there was hardly a
lady of position who had not in her possession some
portion of the spoils of plate and jewels from cities
beyond the sea; while those who, like the Knight of
Chaucer, had been at Alexandra "when it was won,"
returned with cloth of gold, velvets, and precious stones.
In the thirty-seventh year of this reign (1363) the Parliament
held at Westminster enacted several sumptuary
laws against the extravagant use of personal adornment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span>
These state what costume is suited to the various
degrees of rank and income, and are of value for the
information they supply on the prevailing fashions in
jewellery. Restrictions of this kind, re-enacted from
time to time, and apparently of little effect, seem to
have been intended not so much to prevent the gratification
of an instinctive desire for bravery and splendour,
as to make different classes proclaim their rank and
station by their dress.</p>

<p>Chaucer in the Prologue of his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>
affords in a charming manner additional information
about the personal ornaments of the different grades of
English society of his time. He gives detailed description
of the brooch of the yeoman and the nun, and
pictures the merchant with his richly clasped shoes, the
squire with short knife and gypci&egrave;re (purse) at his girdle,
the carpenter's wife with her collar fastened by a brooch
as "broad as the boss of a buckler," and various tradesmen
who, in spite of sumptuary laws, wore pouches,
girdles, and knives of silver:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Hir knives were ychaped not with bras<br />
But all with silver wrought ful clene and wel<br />
Hir girdeles and hir pouches every del.</div></div></div>

<p>The passion for personal ornaments, or "bravouries"
as they were termed, reached its zenith in England
during the reign of the elegant and unfortunate
Richard II, whose courtiers outvied one another in
such extravagances. An anonymous writer of the
period quoted by Camden in his <i>Remaines concerning
Britain</i> speaks of hoods, even those worn by men
of moderate means, as commonly set with gold and
precious stones, while "their girdles are of gold and
silver, some of them worth twenty marks." The king,
in constant want of money, was obliged on several
occasions to deposit the royal jewels with the Corporation
of London as security for loans, and detailed lists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span>
of the objects selected for the purpose are preserved in
the inventories of the Exchequer, and among the city
archives.</p>

<p>In spite of attempted restrictions, and notwithstanding
the disastrous Wars of the Roses, immense
demands appear to have been made upon the productive
powers of the jewellers throughout the whole of the
fifteenth century. The remarkable list of Henry IV's
jewels in the inventories of the Exchequer, and the
most important of royal English inventories of the
Middle Ages, that taken after the death of Henry V
in 1422 (<i>Rotuli Parliamentorum</i>, IV, pp. 214-241), serve
to show that until the end of the century, which may
serve as the termination of the period, extraordinary
extravagance in the style and nature of ornaments as
well as of costume was the order of the day.</p>

<p>Every one who had acquired wealth, or even a modest
competence only, displayed a magnificence far beyond
his means. It was a time when wealth was required in
a compact and tangible form. Owners did not hesitate
to melt down their jewels when desirous of employing
them for other purposes. The change of taste which
shortly came about tended towards similar destruction;
while the Wars of the Roses involved the breaking up
of much that was most sumptuous in material and
beautiful in workmanship.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Throughout the whole of the Christian Middle Ages
the highest efforts of the goldsmith were directed to the
enrichment of the Church and the adornment of its
ministers, and the magnificence which the ritual of
the Church fostered found expression in the jewelled
ornaments of ecclesiastic vestments. In Norman times
ecclesiastical jewellery was extremely luxurious and
costly, and the illuminations of the period show the
cope and chasuble richly bordered with precious stones.
St. Thomas &agrave; Becket wore an extraordinary profusion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span>
of jewels, and descriptions are preserved of the magnificence
of his own person and of his attendants during
a progress he once made through the streets of Paris.
Innocent III, memorable in this country as the Pope to
whom the pusillanimous John surrendered his crown, is
recorded to have commented on the richness of the
costumes and ornaments of the English clergy, with a
hint at the possibility of extracting further sums for the
increase of the papal revenue. The early inventories all
record the splendour of the vestments used in public
worship, and show how pearls, precious stones, and even
ancient cameos, all rendered more beautiful by exquisite
settings, were employed for their enrichment. No
bishop, indeed, was suitably equipped without a precious
mitre with delicate goldsmith's work and inlaid gems,
without a splendid morse or brooch to fasten his cope,
and without a ring, set with an antique gem or a stone
<i>en cabochon</i>, to wear over his embroidered glove.</p>

<p>Of all these rich ornaments scarcely any examples
have survived save a number of rings recovered from
the graves of ecclesiastics. All the more precious,
therefore, are the jewelled ornaments bequeathed in
1404 by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester,
to New College, Oxford, where they are still preserved
as relics of its munificent founder. These unique
examples of medi&aelig;val jewellery date from the closing
years of the fourteenth century&mdash;the period of transition
from Decorated to Perpendicular architecture: a
time when Gothic art had reached its climax; and not
only the architect, but the painter and the goldsmith
were still devoting their utmost efforts on behalf of the
Church, the centre of the whole medi&aelig;val system.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The New College jewels originally decorated William
of Wykeham's precious mitre (<i>mitra pretiosa</i>). Portions
of the groundwork of the mitre sewn with seed pearls,
and its original case of <i>cuir bouilli</i> or boiled leather,
stamped with fleurs-de-lis and bound with iron straps,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span>
are still preserved in the College. Among the jewelled
fragments are hinged bands of silver gilt, formed of
plates of basse-taille enamel representing animals and
grotesques, which alternate with settings of dark blue
pastes and white crystals surrounded by radiating
pearls. These bands probably went round the lower
part of the mitre, and also perhaps ran up the middle
of it, before and behind. The crests of the mitre were
edged with strips of exquisitely chased crocketing in
gold. The other fragments include two rosettes of
beautifully executed Gothic foliation set with white
crystals, together with two quatrefoils in silver gilt and
a cruciform gold ornament set with turquoises.</p>

<p>The chief treasure of the New College collection is
an exquisite gold jewel, a monogram of the Blessed
Virgin, the patron saint of the "College of St. Mary
of Winton in Oxford." It is a crowned Lombardic M;
and might be the rich capital of some medi&aelig;val manuscript,
with its gorgeous colouring faithfully translated
into gold, enamel, pearls, and precious stones. In the
open parts of the letter are figures of the Virgin and
the Angel of the Annunciation in full relief, the angel's
wings being covered with enamel of translucent green.
The space above the head of each figure is occupied
with delicate architectural work of open cuspings. In
the centre of the jewel is a large ruby in the form of a
vase, from which spring three lilies with white enamelled
blossoms. On each side of the vase are three small
emeralds. Remarkable taste is shown in the arrangement
of the precious stones: fine emeralds and rubies,
<i>en cabochon</i>, mounted alternately in raised settings
round the jewel. Two stones, a ruby on the left and
an emerald on the right, are missing. The rest of the
mountings are Oriental pearls somewhat discoloured by
age (<a href="#PLATE_XV">Pl. XV, 1</a>).</p>

<p>It is generally considered that the jewel adorned and
occupied a central place on the mitre, and its dimensions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span>
(2 by 2&frac14; inches) render its employment in that
position probable. As, however, there are no indications
of such an ornament on contemporary representations
of mitres, and above all on the mitre figured on
the founder's own tomb at Winchester, there remains
the possibility of the jewel having been employed as a
brooch or nouche on some other part of the vestment.</p>

<p>This remarkable jewel stands quite alone in point
of excellence. It goes far to justify the contention that
English jewellers at this period, as well as in Saxon
times, equalled, if they did not outstrip, the craftsmen
of other nations in the successful cultivation of the
goldsmith's art.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE MYSTERY OF PRECIOUS STONES</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>NE of the most curious and interesting facts in
connection with the jewellery of the Middle
Ages is the peculiar respect which seems to have
been paid to precious stones. "In a scientific age,"
says Mr. Paton, "it is difficult to apprehend and
sympathise with the state of mind which endowed
natural objects with the properties of charms and
fetiches. Before it was the habit to trace phenomena
to natural causes, faith in occult powers was strong,
and credulity exercised a marked influence on the habits
and actions of the people."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Precious stones, on account
of the mystery and romance attaching to most
things of Eastern origin, had long attracted to themselves
a superstitious reverence; so that their choice
and arrangement, which appear to us merely arbitrary
nowadays, had in the Middle Ages a distinct meaning
consecrated by traditions dating back from very ancient
times. Every stone, like those which enriched the
breast-plate of the High Priest, and those which in St.
John's vision formed the foundations of the Heavenly
Jerusalem, was supposed to possess special powers and
virtues. Abundant proof of this is exhibited in the
medi&aelig;val inventories, where the beauty or rarity of
a stone counted for infinitely less in the estimation
of its value than the reputed talismanic virtue, such as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span>
the toadstone, for example, was supposed to possess.
The medi&aelig;val literature of precious stones,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> wherein is
expounded their medicinal virtues or their supernatural
powers in baffling evil spirits, is based on a classical
poem of about the fourth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
entitled <i>Lithica</i>,
which claims to be a statement of their magic properties
made by the seer Theodamas to the poet
Orpheus. Similar belief in the virtues of precious
stones was still in existence in the sixteenth century,
and finds an exponent in Camillus Leonardus, physician
to C&aelig;sar Borgia, in his work entitled <i>Speculum
Lapidum</i>, published at Venice in 1502. Even as late
as the following century the use of precious stones as
charms was more than half sanctioned by the learned,
and in his <i>Natural History</i> Bacon lays it down as
credible that "precious stones may work by consent
upon the spirits of men to comfort and exhilarate
them." The learned lawyer and philosopher, indeed,
was not in this much superior to the plain and simple
folk who still imagined that every precious stone had
some mystic value communicable to the wearer. About
the same time De Boot, or Boethius, the learned
physician to the Emperor Rudolf II, published his
famous Lapidary, which Mr. C. W. King recommends
as a work worthy of especial study for the properties of
stones, and mentions how it "draws a distinction that
curiously illustrates the struggle then going on between
traditional superstition and common sense."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>With the advance of Christianity the representation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span>
of the subjects of pagan mythology was forbidden by
law; but the old ideas were retained for many years,
and small objects like cameos or intaglios were carried
about concealed upon the person. Later on, when all
knowledge of classical art had sunk into oblivion,
such stones became prized not only for the subjects
engraved on them, which their medi&aelig;val owner
seldom understood, but also for the fact that they were
supposed to possess special talismanic virtues. The
majority of these gems were mounted as rings or as
seals of secular and ecclesiastical personages of rank.</p>

<p>Preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the British
Museum is a thirteenth-century MS. (quoted by Mr.
Wright in <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, Vol. XXX), which contains
instructions for the wearing of various stones, and for
the composition of the different metals of the rings
in which they were to be set. A proof of the firm
establishment of the Romans in Britain is afforded
by the number of their gems brought to light in
medi&aelig;val times; while the decay of the art of gem-engraving
in the Middle Ages is shown by the fact that
the Harleian MS. always refers to these gems as objects
"to be found and not made.... A stone engraved
in one manner you should suspend about the neck,
as it enables you to find treasures, the impression
in wax of another stone will cause men to speak well
of you." The engraving of a dove with a branch of
olive in its mouth should be mounted in a silver ring,
and another gem should be placed in a ring of lead.</p>

<p>From these and similar writings it is clear that one
of the objects aimed at by the medi&aelig;val authors was to
define the different virtues of the sigils engraved upon
precious stones. Such ideas, not previously unknown, as,
for example among the Gnostics, were no doubt stimulated
by the Crusades, whereby the study of alchemy
and the interest in Oriental mysteries became spread
throughout Europe. Leonardus, as late as the sixteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span>
century, observes that stones "if engraved by
a skilful person or under some particular influence,
will receive a certain virtue.... But if the effect
intended by the figure engraved be the same as that
produced by the natural quality of the stone, its virtue
will be doubled, and its efficacy augmented." We see
thus that the talismanic ideas respecting precious stones
were attached as much to their engraving as to the
stones themselves.</p>

<p>Owing to the complete decline of the glyptic art in
the Middle Ages, antique cameos and intaglios, on
account of some fancied assimilation in subject or idea
to Christian symbolism, were occasionally used for
devout subjects. Together with the general ignorance
of classical art, and the consequent attempts that were
made to give the pagan representation upon antique
gems a Christian signification&mdash;frequently in a very
forced and curious manner&mdash;there appears to have been
a certain appreciation of their beauty. When small
relics, such as particles of the wood of the cross, or
larger relics, as bones of the saints, were enclosed either
in portable reliquaries or in costly shrines, such receptacles
were not infrequently encrusted with ancient
cameos and intaglios, as representing the very choicest
objects which the fervent devotion of the age could
select for this sacred purpose. The Shrine of the
Three Kings at Cologne<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and the Treasure of Conques<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
are still enriched with many fine examples of the gem-engraver's
art, and the magnificent gold shrine of
Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey, long
since despoiled, was formerly mounted with numerous
cameos, all probably antique.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The history of the glyptic art has been sufficiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span>
encroached upon here to demonstrate the prominent
place occupied by antique gems in the personal ornaments
of the Middle Ages. Their use for signet rings
will be referred to again; but attention must be drawn
to the three most remarkable examples of their application
to other articles of jewellery&mdash;the Jewel of St. Hilary
and the Cameo of Charles V in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale at Paris, and the Schaffhausen Onyx, preserved
among the archives of the town of Schaffhausen
in Switzerland (<a href="#PLATE_XVI">Pl. XVI</a>).</p>

<p>The Jewel of St. Hilary contains a fine cameo head
in profile of the Emperor Augustus on a sardonyx. It
is enclosed in a frame of silver gilt set with large
rubies, sapphires, and pearls. The jewel was formerly
employed as a pectoral or breast-ornament upon a silver
reliquary bust of St. Hilary preserved in the Treasury
of St. Denis. On the dispersal of the Treasury in 1791,
the jewel was removed to the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale.
The framework dates from the twelfth century. It
measures 3&frac12; by 2&frac12; inches.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The Cameo of Charles V of
France, a sardonyx of three layers, dating from Imperial
Roman times, represents a full length figure of Jupiter.
It is mounted in the gold frame in which it was presented
to the Treasury at Chartres by the King. Such
prophylactic verses<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> as are found frequently side by side
upon amulets and in cabalistic formul&aelig; of the Middle
Ages, are inscribed round its edge on a ground of blue
and red enamel, together with the opening words of St.
John's Gospel, which were supposed to serve as a protection,
particularly against demons and thunder. The
figure of Jupiter with the eagle probably passed for
a representation of the evangelist. At the lower part
is a crowned escutcheon bearing the arms of France,
and on the crown is an inscription recording the presentation
of the jewel by Charles V in the year 1367.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>
This beautiful example of French jewellery of the
fourteenth century is 6 inches in length and 3 in width.</p>

<p>Of slightly later date than the Jewel of St. Hilary,
and of far more elaborate workmanship, though perhaps
less well known on account of its somewhat remote
situation, is the Schaffhausen Onyx. The stone, a fine
sardonyx, is a Roman cameo of a female figure carrying
a cornucopia and caduceus, and intended to represent
Peace. Its setting, a superb specimen of medi&aelig;val
goldwork, is mounted with figures of eagles and lions,
chased in full relief and arranged in regular order
between high bezels set with garnets, sapphires, pearls,
and turquoises. The outside measurement of the jewel
is 6 by 5 inches, and that of the stone 3&frac12; by 3.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The large part played by superstition in the ornaments
of the Middle Ages need not be further enlarged
on. The virtues of charms were not only associated
with gems and precious stones; for mystic letters, cabalistic
inscriptions, and other devices were among the
chief features of medi&aelig;val jewellery. Such devices
lingered long after the Renaissance of learning had
partially dispelled the mysticism of the Middle Ages;
while similar superstitions in respect to precious stones
are even now not entirely extinct, in spite of the assurances
of modern science.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL HEAD-ORNAMENTS AND NECKLACES</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">H</span>EAD-ORNAMENTS from the tenth to the sixteenth
century belong for the most part rather
to the general history of costume than to that
of jewellery proper; and it will be unnecessary to follow
those extravagances of fashion which, especially during
the fifteenth century, were presented by the head-dress
of women. More germane to the subject are the fillets,
bands, and chaplets worn throughout the Middle Ages
by women when their heads were uncovered, and during
a more limited period by men also. The original form
of these was a ribbon, which encircled the brow, held
back the hair from the face, and adjusted the veil;
while wreaths, either of natural flowers or of plain gold,
were a frequent decoration for young women. Hence
the bands or chaplets, which took their motives from
those more simple ornaments, were made either wholly
of metal (<i>cercles</i>), or of gold flowers sewn upon an
embroidered band (described in inventories as <i>chapeletz</i>),
both forms being enriched with pearls and precious
stones. The fillet later on became a heavy band composed
of separate pieces of metal joined by hinges, and
showed such close resemblance to the broad belts of the
knights, that in the inventory of Edward II, quoted
above, <i>tressoures</i> and <i>ceintures</i> are entered together
under one heading. The wearing of such head-ornaments
was not confined exclusively to the nobility, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span>
the receipt of a sale of jewels by Agnes Chalke, spicer
of London, to a certain John of Cambridge in 1363,
includes a "coronal of gold, wrought with stones, that
is to say, with rubyes, saphirs, emeralds, and pearls."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Exquisite circlets set with these gems are worn by
the choir of singing and music-making angels on the
wings of the Van Eycks' famous "Ghent Altar-piece"
in the Berlin Museum. The fillet, whether a complete
circle or hinged, received about the fourteenth
century additional enrichments in the form of trefoils,
fleurs-de-lis, crosses, and foliations, erected on cuspings
upon its upper edge. A simple but charming example
of a circlet, dating from the fourteenth century, is
preserved in the Mus&eacute;e du Cinquantenaire at Brussels.
It is of silver gilt, formed of hinged plaques, each
mounted with from three to four collets set with pearls,
and with pastes in imitation of precious stones, while
additional ornaments in the form of fleurs-de-lis are
fixed erect upon it (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII, 9</a>).</p>

<p>From the diadem of this character originated the
coronets worn by those of high or noble rank; the use
of these, amid the ceremonies of later courts, crystallised
into a system of class privilege. Such diadems
or coronets approach the form of the regal crown, which
in England, as early as the eleventh century, was
enriched with rays and floriations. The regal crown,
with which we are not immediately concerned,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> by the
addition of arches, was converted about the fifteenth
century into what is technically known as the "close"
crown.</p>

<p>Round the helmets of knights in the fifteenth
century ornamental wreaths called <i>orles</i> were worn;
these, originally composed of two bands of silk twisted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span>
together were afterwards richly jewelled. One of the
most famous of jewelled hats was that of Charles the
Bold, thickly encrusted with huge pearls and precious
stones, which was captured by the Swiss after his
death at the battle of Nancy in 1477.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Of female ornaments of the same period it need
only be stated that the elaborate head-dresses, such as
the <i>cornette</i>, <i>escoffion</i>, and <i>henin</i>&mdash;it is sometimes difficult
to imagine how women had sufficient strength to keep
them balanced on their heads&mdash;were profusely adorned
with pearls, gold spangles, and precious stones, and in
some cases with crowns or crown-shaped combs of
elaborate goldwork enriched with gems. The Italians,
with more refined taste, seem, as will be observed (p. 171),
to have escaped from such extravagances sooner than the
rest of Europe, and to have been content for the most
part with a simple <i>bandeau</i> encircling the forehead.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting varieties of personal
ornaments in the Middle Ages are certain jewels or
brooches worn in the hat and known as <i>enseignes</i>.
From the lead signs or ornaments worn by pilgrims
there was gradually evolved a special class of jewels on
which the great artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries exercised their utmost skill, and which at the
present day are among the most highly prized of all
early articles of personal jewellery.</p>

<p>Rivers near large cities have supplied us with much
of the knowledge we possess of the manners and habits
of those who in former times dwelt upon their banks.
Whenever dredging or digging disturbs the beds of
such rivers, objects of antiquity, which seem to have
gravitated there, are sure to be discovered. The municipal
museum of many a city of ancient foundation
preserves choice works of antiquity recovered from its
river's bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span>
Among the most remarkable objects brought to
light in this manner are certain curious medi&aelig;val ornaments,
which belong to the age that has bequeathed
exceedingly few examples of articles for personal use.
The ornaments referred to are the small badges or
signs of lead, given or sold, as tokens, to medi&aelig;val
pilgrims to the shrines of saints or martyrs, and
known as "Pilgrims' Signs." They were obtained
from the attendants at shrines and exhibitions of relics,
who kept ready a large variety bearing the effigy or
device of some particular saint, or the symbol that had
reference to his acts of worship. Each sign or token
was pierced with holes, or more frequently had a pin
cast in one piece with it, making it available as a
brooch. It was thus fastened to the hat or other portion
of the pilgrim's dress as a testimony of his having
visited the particular shrine indicated by the token.
These badges, which date from about the thirteenth to
the fifteenth century, were manufactured at the churches
or monasteries to which pilgrimages were made.
Moulds for casting them are preserved in the British
Museum and the Guildhall Museum; and a forge was
found at Walsingham Priory where the sacristan
melted the metals employed for their manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It will be outside the present purpose to enumerate
all the varieties of form assumed by these interesting
and historically most valuable objects. Important collections
of them are preserved in the British Museum
and Guildhall Museum in London, and in the Mus&eacute;e
Cluny, Paris (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII, 1-4</a>).</p>

<p>In England the most popular relics were those
of Our Lady of Walsingham Priory, and particularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span>
those of St. Thomas of Canterbury, whose signs,
according to a statement of Giraldus Cambrensis, were
worn as early as the twelfth century. The anonymous
author of the supplement to Chaucer's <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> speaks of the purchase of signs by Chaucer's
party on the occasion of their pilgrimage to Canterbury,
and remarks that on their departure from the
Cathedral "they sett their signys upon their hedes, and
som upon their capp." And Erasmus, in his <i>Colloquy
of the pilgrimage for religion's sake</i>, notes that pilgrims
were "covered on every side with images of tin
and lead." Judging from the number and variety of
the badges relating to the murdered archbishop, Becket,
his shrine must have enjoyed a widespread popularity,
though the scallop-shell of St. James of Compostella
was perhaps more universally recognised as a pilgrim's
sign than any other.</p>

<p>These signs or <i>signacula</i> were worn not only on a
pilgrimage, but also formed a customary decoration for
the hat. Some, even in early times, perhaps as early
as the thirteenth century, though partaking of a religious
character, do not seem to have had reference to
any particular shrine, and referred simply to incidents
in popular religious legends. Others were merely
symbols or emblems; yet, like the majority of medi&aelig;val
trinkets, they nearly all displayed religious motives and
were supposed to possess talismanic powers. Louis
XI, the cruel and superstitious King of France, commonly
wore such signs, particularly those of the celebrated
Notre-Dame d'Embrun, stuck round his hat;
and on a visit to Henry, King of Castile, he wore, so
Philip de Comines informs us, a very old hat with
leaden images upon it.</p>

<p>It is very evident that we have here the origin of
the hat-ornaments or <i>enseignes</i> of gold and silver, and
enriched with precious stones and enamels, which,
coming first into use in the fifteenth century, became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span>
extremely popular in the sixteenth, and were worn on
almost every man's hat, and sometimes on those of
women, until the middle of the seventeenth century.
Like those obtained at the shrines, they bore at first
the figure of a saint&mdash;generally a patron saint&mdash;or a
figure of the Virgin. Of signs such as these, some
came to represent the actual badge of the wearer or of
some one to whom he was affectionately attached, while
others took the form of badges of livery, and were
worn in the hats of the retainers of great families.
Philip de Comines records that Lord Bourchier, Governor
of Calais, 1470, wore a ragged staff of gold upon his
bonnet. This was the badge of the Earl of Warwick,
and all his attendants had ragged staves likewise. A
leaden enseigne of a bear and ragged staff (the House of
Warwick), a crowned ostrich feather (Duke of Norfolk),
a hound (Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury), and a dolphin
(badge of the Dauphin&mdash;afterwards Louis XI&mdash;and his
faction, the Armagnacs), together with others of a similar
nature, are in the British Museum (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII, 5-8</a>). The
badges of the Kings of England were employed in the
same manner: and among the British Museum collection
is a hart lodged&mdash;the badge of Richard II, and in the
Guildhall a broom-pod (<i>genista</i>) of the Plantagenets,
and a crown of fleurs-de-lis&mdash;the badge of Henry V.</p>

<p>A considerable number of small shield-shaped
bronze and copper pendants, enamelled with coats of
arms, and having a ring above for suspension, seem
also to have served as badges. There is the possibility
that some were worn by the servants of nobility as
enseignes upon the hat, or perhaps on the left arm or
breast. But the majority appear to have been employed
for the decoration of horse-harness.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Medi&aelig;val hat-badges of gold are of extreme rarity.
The Franks Bequest in the British Museum contains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span>
a choice example. It is a fifteenth-century Flemish
jewel of gold, representing a "pelican in her piety"
standing upon a scroll, and set with a ruby and a small
pointed diamond (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII, 11</a>).
In the Victoria and
Albert Museum is a circular gold enseigne of open-work
enriched with Gothic foliations. The outer rim is set
with seven small rubies. In the centre is an antique
onyx cameo representing a lion. It is Spanish work of
the second half of the fifteenth
century (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII, 10</a>).</p>

<p>These two jewels are clearly hat-ornaments; but it
is often difficult to distinguish between a brooch or
<i>nouche</i> intended to be worn upon the dress and a hat-brooch,
though the latter can, as a rule, be distinguished
by its form or by its subject. The enseigne was sometimes
employed like a brooch for fastening a plume
decoration, but as a rule served as an independent ornament,
and appears on the paintings, sculpture, and
tapestry of the fifteenth century attached to the side of
the head-gear. It became a jewel of still greater importance
in the sixteenth century, and will be further
dealt with among the jewellery of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>The talismanic properties associated with the <i>signacula</i>
procured at the shrines were extended to many
objects of base metal, as brooches and finger-rings,
which had been placed in contact with relics of saints,
or blessed at their shrines. Brooches and rings also
of gold and silver bear talismanic inscriptions. A
common inscription is the names of the Three Kings&mdash;as
on the Glenlyon brooch&mdash;which originated in pilgrimages
to the shrine of the Kings of the East in the
church of Sant' Eustorgio at Milan, or more probably to
that in Cologne Cathedral. The names of the "Three
Kings of Collein" were considered to be a charm against
epilepsy or the "falling sickness." Many personal
ornaments of base metal, however, are quite unconnected
with any religious practice or with pilgrims'
signs; for objects of pewter are often merely replicas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span>
of more precious jewels in gold and silver, and must
have been worn by the poorer classes. The fact that
several are plated or washed with silver shows that they
were intended to pass for the real objects. Yet they
are of considerable importance, since we find among
them types of ornaments which do not exist in the
precious metals. It may be suggested that some were
made as models for real articles of jewellery; but we
are, unfortunately, not in possession of evidence (such
as can be produced in connection with the jewellery of
the Renaissance) which can offer any likelihood that
this is actually the case with these medi&aelig;val ornaments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>EARRINGS</b></p>

<p>Though common in the Merovingian and Carlovingian
epoch, earrings appear to have been worn only
to a limited extent, and that at the commencement of
the period at present under discussion. Pendants
formed of quadrilateral prisms set on each side with
cabochon garnets and hung with small strings of garnet
beads are attached to the ears of the tenth-century
figure of St. Foy in the treasury at Conques; though
it is not impossible that these, like many of the gems
that adorn the statue, may be of earlier workmanship.
That the Byzantine style of earring, of crescent form,
was worn during the eleventh and twelfth centuries is
evident from a twelfth-century bronze ewer, in the
shape of a head of a woman, of Flemish work, in the
Museum of Budapest.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Earrings, however, enjoyed
no great popularity during the Middle Ages, and the
cause of this must be traced to the fashion which prescribed
for women a style of coiffure by which the hair
fell down at the sides, or was covered by a veil, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span>
would have effectively hidden any ornaments for the
ear. It was only at the end of the fourteenth century
that fashion again allowed the hair to be worn high.
Pendent rings of gold for ladies' ears are mentioned
in the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, and statues occasionally exhibit
short earrings, pearls attached to the lobe of
the ear, or stones in the form of drops. Earrings,
indeed, did not come into very common use until
the close of the fifteenth or the beginning of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>NECKLACES AND COLLARS</b></p>

<p>The custom of wearing necklaces and neck-chains
was much more limited during the Middle Ages than
it had been in antiquity and at the time of the great
migrations. Women's necklaces can hardly be proved
to have been in general use before the end of the
fourteenth century, and during the Middle Ages
seldom attained the exaggerated style they exhibited
at the period of the Renaissance. They consisted
mostly of plaited cords of gold wire, and probably of
single or double chains of pearls. These originally
encircled the throat, but at a later date were worn more
upon the breast. Though many forms of personal
ornament are mentioned in early wills and inventories,
we rarely meet with a reference to the necklace until
the fourteenth century; nor is it pictured on monumental
effigies or brasses until the beginning of the
century following. If worn at all prior to this date, it
must simply have served the purpose of supporting
pendants of various forms known as <i>pentacols</i>.</p>

<p>These neck-chains, or collars as they were termed,
soon began to receive additional enrichment, and the
inventories of the fifteenth century contain frequent
descriptions of necklets adorned with enamels and
precious stones. Eleanor, Countess of Arundel (1455),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>
bequeathed to her daughter "a golden collar for the
neck, with a jewel set with precious stones hanging
thereat." The fashion for rich necklaces was especially
in vogue at the luxurious Court of the Dukes of Burgundy;
nor had the Court of Richard II been behindhand
in the display of this species of ornament, for the
magnificent wedding presents of his wife, Isabella of
France, included a collar of gold set with precious
stones of immense value.</p>

<p>The word <i>carcanet</i> seems to have come into use
about this time for rich necklaces of precious stones,
and to have been applied a little later to the bands of
jewels commonly entwined in ladies' hair.</p>

<p>Though never so generally worn as in the sixteenth
century, a considerable number of these jewelled ornaments
are represented in the exquisite paintings of the
fifteenth century. One of the most elaborate of all is
the superb gold necklet, brilliantly enamelled with
small and many-coloured flowers, shown on the portrait
of Maria, wife of Pierantonio Baroncelli, in the Uffizi
Gallery at Florence, by an unknown Flemish painter
of the latter part of the fifteenth century. Close by, in
the same gallery, is Van der Goes' celebrated triptych,
presented to the Spedale di Santa Maria Nuova by
Tommaso Portinari, agent of the Medici in Bruges.
Upon the right wing is Maria, wife of the donor, with
her daughter. The former wears a magnificent necklace
of exquisite design, its interlacing goldwork shaped
into the form of roses enamelled red, white, and blue,
each set respectively with a sapphire, a ruby, and a
large pearl. The latter is adorned with a necklace
composed of a double row of pearls connected by
oval jewelled ornaments; beneath is hung a trefoil-shaped
pendant set with rubies, to which is attached a
large drop-pearl (p. 117). A precisely similar ornament
is seen in another work by Van der Goes, painted
about 1473&mdash;the well-known portrait of Margaret,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span>
queen of James III of Scotland, now at Holyrood.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
This picture was probably executed in Flanders from
material supplied by the donor, and the artist appears
to have adorned Queen Margaret with the same beautiful
necklace, probably of Florentine workmanship,
which he had seen round the neck of Signorina
Portinari.</p>

<p>Jane Shore, the beautiful and unfortunate mistress
of Edward IV, and wife of the rich jeweller of Lombard
Street, is represented in her two portraits, one at King's
College, Cambridge, and the other at Eton, wearing
elaborate necklaces. Around her throat are two strings
of pearls, with a necklet below of circular pieces of
Gothic pattern, supporting a lozenge-shaped pendant of
similar design adorned with pearls. Among sculptured
representations of the necklet the most interesting is
that on the monument of Sir John Crosby (d. 1475)
and his wife in St. Helen's Church, Bishopsgate,
where the latter wears a very handsome necklace of
roses, to which is attached a cluster of three roses with
three pendants below. Sir John's collar is somewhat
similarly formed of rosette-shaped ornaments. An
early instance of a heavy neck-chain of gold, worn
upon the breast, is to be seen upon the famous tapestry,
considered to represent Henry VI and his Queen, in
St. Mary's Hall, Coventry.</p>

<p>Collars of extraordinary richness seem to have been
worn by Henry IV; for among the miscellaneous documents
preserved at St. Paul's Cathedral<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> is a list of
various jewels set with diamonds both large and
small, with balas rubies, sapphires, and clusters of
pearls, which were to be employed for making collars
for the king and queen. The Inventories of the
Exchequer contain frequent reference to what is termed
the <i>Iklyngton Coler</i>. This magnificent collar, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span>
was frequently pawned by Henry VI, was enriched with
four rubies, four large sapphires, thirty-two great pearls,
and fifty-three pearls of a lesser
sort.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the purely ornamental necklaces, collars
or chains of "livery"&mdash;bearing the heraldic devices of
the day&mdash;were assumed by various royal and noble
families, and were bestowed as marks of favour or
friendship on persons of various ranks, and both sexes,
who wore them as badges of adherence to those families.
An instance of the bestowal of a chain of this kind
occurred in 1477 after the siege of Quesnoy by Louis XI,
who, witnessing a great feat of gallantry on the part of
Raoul de Lannoy, is reported to have placed on his neck
a chain of great value, and to have thus wittily addressed
him: "Mon ami, vous &ecirc;tes trop furieux en un
combat; il faut vous <i>encha&icirc;ner</i>, car je ne veux point
vous perdre, d&eacute;sirant me servir encore de vous plusieurs
fois."</p>

<p>Richard II, as shown by the Earl of Pembroke's
remarkable picture of that monarch at Wilton, wore,
in addition to his device the white hart, a collar of
broom-pods. Henry IV employed the well-known
collar of SS, derived from his father John of Gaunt.
The collar of Edward IV was composed of two of his
badges, the sun in its splendour, and the white rose;
while a third, the white lion of March, was added as
a pendant. Richard III retained the Yorkist collar,
substituting for the lion pendant a
boar.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Private family
collars were also worn, and an early instance of one
occurs in the brass of Thomas Lord Berkeley (1417) in
the church of Wootton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire;
the band round the neck being charged with mermaids,
the badge of the Berkeleys.</p>

<p>The SS collar is the best known of all. It is composed
of the letter S in gold repeated indefinitely,
either fixed on velvet or some material, or forming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span>
the links of a chain. The letters are generally united
by knots; they sometimes terminate with portcullises
and have a pendent rose. The collar is still
worn by the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Mayor of
London, and the chief heralds&mdash;that belonging to the
Lord Mayor being an original and beautiful example of
English jewellery of the sixteenth century. Despite all
that has been written upon the SS collar no conclusive
explanation has been offered as to its origin and
meaning.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Several representations of livery collars
appear upon monumental effigies of the latter half of
the fifteenth century, and there is frequent mention of
them in the inventories of the same period, but, with
the exception of the SS collar, they are not met with at
all in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL PENDANTS, ROSARIES, AND POMANDERS</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE wearing of religious emblems in the form of
pendants by the Christians of the Middle Ages
was possibly, in the first place, the unconscious
perpetuation of pagan superstition. The demand for a
convenient mode of carrying a reliquary may account
in some degree for the use of necklaces in early times.</p>

<p>Relics of the saints and of the Passion of our Lord
were most eagerly sought after by medi&aelig;val Christendom,
and whenever a relic of unusual importance
was obtained, all the resources of the art of the
time were employed to give it a worthy setting. The
most famous of early pendent reliquaries was that worn
by the Emperor Charlemagne, which contained relics
from the Crown of Thorns and the True Cross, presented
to him by Haroun al-Raschid. The reliquary
was buried with him in 814, and found at the opening
of his tomb at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1169. In 1804 it was
given to the Emperor Napoleon by the clergy of Aix,
and was afterwards the property of Napoleon III; but it
disappeared during the troublous times that terminated
the Second Empire. The relics were enclosed under a
large sapphire magnificently set in gold and precious
stones<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl. XVIII, 4</a>). Another historical relic of the
early Middle Ages was the enamelled gold cross suspended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span>
from a chain, which was stolen from the tomb
of Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey in 1685
and given to James II. It was only lost sight of in
the early part of the nineteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Portable reliquaries in former times were often
made of two plates of rock crystal or other transparent
stones hinged together so as to form a box. An
exquisite example of this style of ornament, and one
of the most remarkable medi&aelig;val jewels, is the so-called
reliquary of St. Louis in the British Museum.
It is of gold, set with two large bean-shaped amethysts
which act as covers to an inner case with a lid,
enclosing what purports to be a spike from the Crown
of Thorns. The back of this receptacle, as well as the
insides of the covers, is enriched with minute translucent
enamels representing the Crucifixion and other
scenes from the Passion and the life of Christ
(<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl. XVIII, 5</a>). The jewel
is said to have been given
by St. Louis (who bought the Crown of Thorns from
Baldwin, King of Jerusalem) to a king of Aragon, but
the style of the work is somewhat later than the time
of St. Louis, and dates from about the year 1310. It
was formerly in the collection of Baron Pichon, and
was presented to the British Museum by Mr. George
Salting in 1902.</p>

<p>The pendent ornaments of the Middle Ages not
only served as receptacles for relics but also took the
form of crosses, medallions, votive tablets, and monograms.
Though these do not attain the same importance
as the pendants of the Renaissance, their
extraordinary variety is proved by the inventories of
the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, while their beauty
is attested by the few examples that have fortunately
been preserved. Small votive tablets, that is to say
diptychs or triptychs with hinged wings, were exceedingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span>
popular as personal ornaments, judging by their
frequent occurrence in the inventories under the title
of <i>tableau</i> or <i>tabulet</i>. They were suspended from the
girdle or neck-chain. Some are painted with delicate
translucent enamels, others contain figures in high
relief wrought in metal, or carvings in boxwood of
minute dimensions. The last are generally Flemish,
while the others of which there are several splendid
examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum, are
mostly of French or of English workmanship. A
very remarkable silver-gilt pendant in the form of the
Devil of temptation, with the forbidden fruit in one
hand and a crozier, signifying power, in the other, is
shown on <a href="#PLATE_XIX">Plate XIX, 9</a>. It is
Burgundian work of the
second half of the fifteenth century, and is the property
of Mrs. Percy Macquoid.</p>

<p>An interesting class of pendants is formed by a
somewhat extensive series of silver and silver-gilt ornaments
produced by German craftsmen of the fifteenth
century. The National Museum at Munich, where
several fine examples of this kind are preserved, possesses
one of more than ordinary interest. It is of
silver-gilt, about five inches in length, composed of
elaborate Gothic tracery, in shape not unlike the tall
Gothic tabernacles of South Germany, of which that
by Adam Kraft in St. Lawrence's Church at Nuremberg
is perhaps the finest example. A niche on each of
its four sides contains the figure of a saint and above,
half hidden among the tracery, are four female figures.
The jewel is surmounted by the Virgin and Child, and
has three rings above for suspension and one below
(<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX, 1</a>). Other examples
of South German goldsmith's
work of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century
take the form of small pendent charms picturing some
religious theme. The figure of a saint was naturally a
favourite subject, since it was supposed to possess
special prophylactic powers. The variety of the subjects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span>
thus represented can be admirably judged from an
important series of such pendants at South Kensington.
In addition to these, which are mostly of cast
silver, other pendants of the same period include silver
plaques, nielloed, engraved, or in relief; and likewise
fine cameos or reliefs of mother-of-pearl, and carvings
in ivory and wood, set in coronets of silver-gilt.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Medi&aelig;val neck-pendants were, as has been observed,
known as <i>pentacols</i>. In the inventory of Edward III
in 1339<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> we find a pentacol composed of a large Scotch
pearl (<i>perle d'Escoce</i>) and an image of Our Lady in
enamel; and "<i>un pentacol dor od. iiij. petites ameraldes
et iiij. petites rubies environ, et une camahue en mylieu</i>."
In medi&aelig;val inventories and wills the Latin word
<i>monile</i> signified not only a necklace, but jewels hung
at the neck. The same term was also employed for
the morse, particularly when the latter had a ring for
suspension. Many pendants generally provided with
quatrefoil rings, come from South Germany (like one
shown on <a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Plate XVIII, 1</a>) and especially
from Bohemia&mdash;there
is a good collection of them in the cathedral
treasury of
Prague.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The majority are silver-gilt, and
set with a plaque of mother-of-pearl or crystal, and
are usually hollow, to contain relics. The term <i>monile</i>
was further applied to brooches or <i>nouches</i>; and the
nouches described in such detail in the English inventories
of the fifteenth century, which will be mentioned
later when the subject of brooches is dealt with,
may in part have been employed as ornaments for the
necklace.</p>

<p>Various <i>monilia</i> or pendants, containing small relics,
verses from the Bible, the names of Christ or the Virgin
written upon vellum or upon metal, and perhaps also
ancient magic spells&mdash;all possessing the virtues of
talismans, were worn by chains or cords round the neck,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span>
and in some instances very likely hidden under the
upper garment. The early Church, in many an edict,
declared itself against this form of superstition, yet
such pendants or phylacteries&mdash;a term applied to any
amulet worn about the person against evil of all kinds&mdash;appear
to have been extensively used. Another and
popular pendant from the fourteenth to the sixteenth
century, which is frequently cited in inventories, but
now rarely met with, takes the form of a small circular
box or capsule bearing in front an <i>Agnus Dei</i> in niello
or repouss&eacute;, surrounded by a corded edging. Such
boxes were intended for the preservation of a roundel
of wax moulded from the remains of the Paschal
candle at Rome with an impression of the sacred Lamb,
and blessed by the Pope for distribution to the faithful.
The cases, of silver-gilt, have occasionally a covering
of transparent horn on the back and front. An example
of this kind, of fifteenth-century German workmanship,
is in the Victoria and Albert Museum (<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX, 3</a>).
The wax it contains bears the name of Pope Urban VI
(1378-1389). An original stamp of bronze, of Italian
origin, dating from the fourteenth century, which was
used for making these wax impressions, is preserved in
the British Museum along with other moulds for casting
medals and small articles of jewellery.</p>

<p>In addition to the precious and semi-precious stones
already mentioned, other objects, accounted specially
efficacious for certain purposes, were worn. The <i>peres
de eagle</i>, also called <i>&aelig;tites</i>, supposed to be found
in the nest of the eagle, were particularly valuable
during childbirth. <i>Glossopetr&aelig;</i>, the fossilised teeth
of certain kinds of shark, which passed as serpents'
teeth, were much used, as well as primitive arrowheads.
They were hung round the neck of infants in
the belief that they assisted dentition and kept off
frights. Of great value also was the bezoar stone,
which, like glossopetr&aelig;, at one time occupied a prominent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span>
place in pharmacop&oelig;ia. Coral, which has always
been popular, is first mentioned in English wills and
inventories in the fourteenth century. It was used for
rosaries, and, above all, as a charm&mdash;a ring of gold
or silver being attached to its stalk. The Romans tied
little branches of it round their children's necks to
ward off the evil eye; and the infant Saviour in many
an early Italian picture is represented wearing a piece
of coral in a similar
manner.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>A fear of poison, common for centuries in royal
courts, was responsible for the custom of testing
meats and drinks by methods founded upon certain
ancient and groundless beliefs. In order to neutralise
or detect the presence of poison, certain objects were
placed in contact with food or were dipped into liquids.
The touching-pieces (<i>tousches</i>) or proofs (<i>espreuves</i>)
employed for the purpose, and considered especially
efficacious against poison, were toadstones, glossopetr&aelig;,
serpentine, jasper, agate and particularly the unicorn's
horn. What was foisted upon the credulous public as
the horn of the fabled animal was in reality the horn or
tusk of a fish&mdash;the narwhal or sea-unicorn of the
northern seas. Being an object of very great value,
the horn was only occasionally kept entire, like the
one preserved to this day at New College, Oxford. It
was more usually cut into pieces and used as "proofs."</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
An angry unicorne in his full career<br />

</div></div></div>

<p>These and other objects, when worn upon the person,
as was generally the practice, were mounted at one
end, or surrounded by a claw-like band of silver.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span>
Another object which occupied an important position
in the Middle Ages and often received special
attention at the hands of the goldsmith was the rosary.
It was suspended occasionally from the neck, but was
more often worn upon the wrist, at the girdle, or
attached to a finger ring, and was formed of a string
of beads of various sizes and materials representing
Aves, Paternosters, and Glorias: each bead receiving
the name of the prayer it represented. The rosary,
as at the present day, was divided into decades of Aves,
each decade being preceded by a Paternoster and
followed by a Gloria. The materials of which they
were composed are well illustrated in the
inventory<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of
the jewels belonging to Adam Ledyard, a London
jeweller in 1381. It includes: "4 sets of paternosters
of white amber; 16 sets of paternosters of amber;
5 sets of paternosters of coral and geet [jet]; 6 sets of
aves of geet, and paternosters of silver-gilt; 38 sets of
aves of geet, with gaudees of silver-gilt; 14 sets of
aves of blue glass, with paternosters of silver-gilt; 28
sets of paternosters of geet; 15 sets of paternosters of
mazer; and 5 sets of paternosters of white bone for
children."</p>

<p>The makers of these beads were termed paternosterers;
and Paternoster Row and Ave Maria Lane
were so called from the "turners of beads" who resided
there. In Paris, as early as the thirteenth century,
the commerce in rosaries was a most flourishing one,
and it was customary there to divide the makers or
dealers in these articles into three categories&mdash;paternosterers
of bone and horn, of coral and mother-of-pearl,
and of amber and jet. In England the rosary makers
do not seem to have been so specialised.</p>

<span class="caption">medi&aelig;val pendants</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The larger beads were sometimes of gold, silver,
and silver-gilt, of open-work, beautifully chased and
engraved, and of boxwood and ivory exquisitely carved.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span>
The "gaudees" or "gauds" in the above quotation, the
ornaments or trinkets attached to the rosary, were
commonly in the form of a crucifix, while the small
German charms mentioned above (p. 120) were mostly
employed for the same purpose. Of the spherical-shaped
gauds or nuts pendent to the rosary, called in
French <i>grains de chapelet</i> and known in Germany
as <i>Betn&uuml;sse</i>, many fine examples exist in boxwood.
They have often an open-work case which opens with
a hinge, and displays two hemispheres filled with a
number of carved figures of minute proportions.</p>

<p>Among the many forms assumed by medi&aelig;val
pendants were those of fruits&mdash;generally apples or pears.
These fruit-shaped pendants, containing either figures
or relics, were exceedingly popular. They were carried
in the purse or attached to the rosary or to the girdle,
or in the case of men, were hung from the neck by
a cord or chain; and were constructed so as to be
opened during devotions. One of the most remarkable
examples is in the Waddesdon Bequest at the British
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The use of perfumes prevailed at all periods of the
Middle Ages. They were enclosed in various receptacles,
and especially in those shaped like a pear or
apple. These pendent scent cases or <i>pomanders</i>, worn
like other pendants of the same form, were in general
use throughout the whole of the period extending from
the fourteenth to the seventeenth century. Pomander
in early inventories is often spelt <i>pomeambre</i>, indicating
its derivation from <i>pomme d'ambre</i>, a perfume apple or
ball; the word <i>pomme</i> being used for any object resembling
an apple in shape, and <i>ambre</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> for perfume in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span>
general. Primarily the pomander seems often to have
designated a ball composed of various highly scented
substances which served the purpose both of counteracting
the smells which must have been particularly
general and offensive in olden days, and also of protecting
against infection. It was enclosed in a rich
metal case, opening across the centre, and perforated so
as to allow the scent to escape. The title "pomander"&mdash;originally
meaning simply a scent or perfume ball&mdash;was
given to the case which contained it. In many
instances, the perfumes, instead of being mixed together
into a ball, were placed in the pomander case
each in a separate compartment, the lids of which are
found inscribed with the names of the contents. These
compartments, varying in number from four to as many
as sixteen, are formed like segments of an orange.
They are hinged below, and united at the top by a
screw or pin, which being removed, allows the segments
to open out (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl. XVIII, 3</a>).</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL BROOCHES&mdash;THE RING-BROOCH</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE brooches or fibul&aelig; hitherto considered have
been constructed either with a spring pin or
<i>acus</i>, which was held in its place by a hook or
catch, or with a hinged acus, which, having pierced the
material, was fixed similarly by a catch, and prevented
by the weight of the garment from becoming unloosened.
The term <i>fibula</i>, generally employed by arch&aelig;ologists
to denote all early brooches, has so far been applied
only to the dress-fasteners of classical times; and
though the word brooch (from the French <i>broche</i>,
meaning a spit) was not introduced into England until
after the Norman Conquest, it is for the sake of clearness
used here to describe what are generally known
among Anglo-Saxon ornaments as fibul&aelig;.</p>

<p>In later Roman times, and among the Irish and
Anglo-Saxons, the ring-brooch was sometimes formed
with an opening on one side, and the pin or acus, which
was not hinged, but moved freely to any part of the
ring, having been passed through the tissue, was
brought through this opening. The ring was then
turned till the pin rested upon its rim.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest the opening
of the brooch is closed, the ring becomes flat and has a
pin of the same length as its diameter. Instead of
running loosely, the pin is hinged upon a constriction
of the ring and it either traverses the tissue which has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span>
been brought through the latter, or a band is passed
over it from beneath the sides of the ring. When the
portions of the garment thus connected are drawn back,
the pin falls across the front of the ring and is held
securely in its place. This ring-brooch was known as
the <i>fermail</i> (Latin <i>firmaculum</i>, signifying a clasp)&mdash;a
term employed both in old French and old English
inventories.</p>

<p>The ring-brooch was worn by both sexes. It
appears on the monumental effigy of Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion at Rouen, on that of Berengaria his queen at
Le Mans, and on several of the thirteenth-century
sculptures on the west front of Wells Cathedral. It
served to gather up the fulness of the surcoat on the
breast of the knight, as shown by the effigy, known as
that of William Mareschel the Elder, Earl of Pembroke,
in the Temple Church; but was generally used
to close the opening in the robes at the throat of
either sex and is seen thus on many effigies of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Among the few examples of medi&aelig;val jewellery that
have survived, brooches and finger rings predominate.
Brooches differ slightly according to the nationality to
which they belong: those of English origin forming
of themselves a class of considerable variety and extent.
The earliest were circles of small diameter and narrow
frame, either plain, or decorated with simple designs.
Mystic words and letters were subsequently added; but
as the brooch became larger, amatory mottoes took their
place. Religious formul&aelig; were also employed, particularly
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when
the brooch reached its full development.</p>

<p>The various inscriptions and designs engraved on
medi&aelig;val brooches are of great interest. The majority
of inscriptions are mottoes in French, such as were
frequently employed as posies upon rings and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span>
love-gifts. An inscription which occurs more than once
is <span class="smcap">io&nbsp;.&nbsp;svi&nbsp;.&nbsp;ici&nbsp;.&nbsp;en&nbsp;.&nbsp;liev&nbsp;.&nbsp;dami.</span> Another
<i>chanson</i>,
reading thus in modern French&mdash;<i>Je suis ici, &agrave; toi voici</i>,
is found on several brooches in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The dainty Prioress, Madame Eglentine, in the
prologue of Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i> wore&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">... a broche of gold ful shene,</span><br />
On whiche was first y-written a crouned A,<br />
And after, <i>Amor vincit omnia</i>.</div></div></div>

<p>The popularity of this last motto on the personal ornaments
of the Middle Ages may be attributed to its
supposed influence as a love-charm. A considerable
number of legends are of a religious character, with
allusions to the Virgin and Saviour while a few are
talismanic, and contain inscriptions such as the names
of the Kings of the East.</p>

<p>Ring-brooches, though generally circular, show a
variety of other shapes, such as hearts, trefoils, lozenges,
etc. A heart-shaped brooch of fine workmanship in
chased and engraved gold is in the Victoria and Albert
Museum. It appears to be French and of the fifteenth
century. Upon its back is the inscription&mdash;<i>Nostre et
tout ditz a vostre [d]esir.</i></p>

<p>The brooches worn by the wealthy are often magnificent
examples of jewellery, enriched with gems set
in delicate goldwork. A number of the existing
brooches are of such diminutive size&mdash;less than half an
inch in diameter&mdash;that they could only have been
employed for fastening the very thinnest tissue. The
larger gold ring-brooches, of fine workmanship and set
with precious stones, are of great rarity. In the British
Museum are several choice specimens: the finest,
formerly in the Londesborough Collection, dates from
the fourteenth century. It is mounted with pearls,
cabochon sapphires and emeralds, arranged in a variety
of settings, and further enriched with four bosses carved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span>
and pierced in the forms of dragons and cockatrices. A
remarkable brooch of the thirteenth century, also from
a well-known collection, that of Baron Pichon, is preserved
in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is a
circular gold ring two inches in diameter, enriched with
four sapphires and six rubies in high cone-like settings
formed of simple sheets of metal wrapped round the
stones. The bases of these collets are hidden on the
inner side by an encircling wreath of vine leaves
delicately cut and stamped in gold. The back is ornamented
with a leaf design in niello. There is a somewhat
similar brooch, though only a fragment, in the
Gem Room of the British Museum.</p>

<p>A gold brooch also dating from the thirteenth
century, and, like the majority, of French workmanship,
is in the Carrand Collection in the Museo Nazionale
(Bargello), Florence. This fine example, formerly in the
Debruge Collection, is decorated with exquisite Gothic
foliage in naturalistic style, and with figures of two
lions in full relief. It is set with two large rubies
and four small emeralds. In the same collection is an
extremely interesting brooch, likewise French, and of
the fourteenth century. A flat ring of gold 1&frac14; inches
in diameter is ornamented with concentric rings of
enamel, the two outer being blue and the inner white.
Upon the latter, in letters reserved in the gold, is the
inscription <span class="smcap">iesus autem traisiens per
med.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which
occurs also on the cameo of Charles V at Paris, and
was held by those who bore it to possess a prophylactic
virtue. The brooch is further ornamented with four
vernicles<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
engraved with exquisite feeling at equal
distances upon its surface (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX, 2</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Though comparatively many existing brooches are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span>
of gold, a great quantity were formerly produced not
only in silver, but in baser metals, such as iron, copper,
and lead or pewter. How large was the demand for
brooches of these materials can be gauged from a
French writer of the thirteenth century, Jean de
Garlande, a poet and grammarian, who in his Latin
vocabulary refers to brooch-makers as a special class of
craftsmen, who, apart from goldsmiths, were sufficiently
numerous to bear the title of <i>fermailleurs</i><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>&mdash;makers of
fermails. To about the end of the fifteenth century
belongs a satirical poem printed in London with the
title <i>Cocke Lorelles Bote</i>, where "latten workers and
broche makers" are specially mentioned among the
London crafts or trades. The manufacture of the finest
brooches, however, was always reserved for the goldsmiths&mdash;a
fact indicated by the quartering of brooches
on the arms of the Goldsmiths' Company.</p>

<p>There would be no justification for any general
reference to medi&aelig;val ring-brooches that omitted to
give some account of those worn in Scotland. Brooches
formed an indispensable accessory to the Highland
dress of both sexes, in that they served to fix upon the
shoulder an invariable article of clothing of the Highlanders&mdash;the
Scottish plaid. In the latest development
of the Scottish brooch of the Celtic type, the pin, as
has been observed, is hinged upon the ring, and after
piercing the garment is held in its place by a catch at
the back of the brooch. Upon the introduction of the
ring-brooch with a pin equal to the diameter of the
ring, this mode of fastening was only in very few cases
retained, and preference in general was given to the
English manner of adjustment.</p>

<p>The earliest form of the Scottish ring-brooch, which
dates from about the thirteenth century, is a flattened
circular ring, upon which talismanic inscriptions in
Latin, generally of a religious character, almost invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span>
appear. These, together with some traces of
Gothic design, last throughout the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. After this period the knowledge of
Latin seems to decrease, for it is rendered so barbarously
on the sixteenth-century brooches as to be almost
unintelligible. On the later brooches the decoration
is purely ornamental, with interlaced work and foliaceous
scrolls, and brooches of this type, on which the character
of an earlier period is retained, were made as late as the
eighteenth century. The designs of the silver brooches
were produced by engraving accompanied by niello
work; those of the brass brooches usually by engraving
alone.</p>

<p>The National Museum of Antiquities at Edinburgh
possesses a large and important collection of Scottish
brooches, while a few Highland families have preserved
for many generations massive silver brooches of elaborate
workmanship. Formerly in the possession of the
Campbells of Glenlyon, and now in the British
Museum, is a brooch known as the Glenlyon brooch.
It dates from about the fifteenth century. It is about
3&frac12; inches in width, and is formed of a flat ring set with
pearls on tall cone-shaped turrets, alternating with
crystals and pieces of amethyst. Across the centre
is a richly decorated bar, upon which rest the points
of two pins attached to the edge of the ring. On
the back of the brooch, in black-letter, is the favourite
inscription of medi&aelig;val amulets:
<span class="smcap">caspar&nbsp;.&nbsp;melchior&nbsp;.&nbsp;baltazar&nbsp;.&nbsp;consumatum.</span>
The last word, the declaration
of the dying Saviour, "It is finished," was
often inscribed upon brooches and other ornaments
of the Middle Ages, as were likewise the Angelic Salutation,
the <i>titulus</i> <span class="smcap">i.n.r.i.</span>, and other so-called <i>caracts</i>,
all of which were considered to possess some talismanic
efficacy.</p>

<span class="caption2">(the glenlyon and loch buy brooches)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In many cases the open space in the middle of the
ring, as in modern brooches, was filled up, and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span>
early examples was sometimes occupied by a turret-like
ornamentation set with a crystal, while obelisks rising
from the ring of the brooch were set with polished
stones such as cairngorms (still popular on Scottish
jewellery), or with Scottish pearls.</p>

<p>The finest examples of this type of brooch are known
as the "brooch of Lorn," the "Ugadale brooch," and
the "Loch Buy brooch." The brooch of Lorn, still in
the possession of the lineal descendants of the Macdougals
of Lorn, dates from the fifteenth century.
It consists of a disc of silver 4&frac12; inches in diameter,
enriched with filigree. In the centre is a raised capsule
crowned with a large rock crystal, and round the ring
of the brooch a circle of eight obelisks. The Ugadale
brooch, the property of the Macneals of Firfergus, is of
somewhat similar nature, save that the turrets, eight
in number, are towards the centre of the brooch and
arranged close round the raised crystal. The Loch
Buy brooch, of more elaborate workmanship, is likewise
surmounted by a cabochon crystal on a raised
dais. On the ring, within a low border, are ten tall
turrets, each surmounted with a Scottish pearl. This
famous brooch, long in the possession of the Macleans
of Loch Buy in the Isle of Mull, came later into the
collection of Ralph Bernal, one of the first and most
eminent of latter-day connoisseurs, at whose sale in
1855 it was purchased by the British Museum.</p>

<p>In addition to the Highland circular brooches, a
considerable number in the shape of hearts have been
found in Scotland, sometimes surmounted with a
crown, and in a few instances set with jewels (p. 165).
They were mostly love-tokens and betrothal gifts, and
many of them bear on the reverse the word <span class="smcap">love.</span>
Brooches of this form are known as "Luckenbooth"
brooches, from their having been commonly sold in
the Luckenbooths, the street stalls around St. Giles'
Church on the High Street, Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span>
The use of the word Luckenbooth calls to mind
the fact that the goldsmiths of Paris also worked and
dwelt in booths, which as late as the fourteenth
century were situated on the Pont du Change and the
Pont N&ocirc;tre Dame. In this connection it is worth
noticing that in England, as well as in France and
Scotland, the working goldsmiths, like the followers
of other trades, occupied distinct quarters by themselves,
and they had in London one part of the Chepe
set apart for them to dwell and trade in. The custom
of the various crafts thus confining themselves to particular
quarters, which is of remote antiquity, greatly
facilitated the formation and government of trade
guilds.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL BROOCHES</b> (<i>continued</i>)<b>&mdash;PECTORALS</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>NOTHER species of brooch peculiar to the
Middle Ages is the pectoral, an article for fastening
on to the middle of the breast. It is similar
to our modern brooch, but differs in that it did not
always serve to hold the dress together. In earlier
centuries it was often sewn on the garment, and was
only occasionally supplied with a pin. It was worn by
both sexes, as well as by ecclesiastics, who appear to
have borne in mind the chief ornament worn by the
Jewish High Priest.</p>

<p>The earliest and most remarkable example of this
class is the great gold pectoral&mdash;the Eagle Fibula it is
termed&mdash;found in 1880 at Mainz&mdash;that ancient and
historical Rhenish city, known in former times from its
commercial prosperity as "Goldene Mainz," which has
proved extraordinarily rich in discoveries dating from
classical and early medi&aelig;val periods. This famous jewel,
both on account of its size (4 by 3&#8541; inches) and good
state of preservation, probably deserves to rank first
among all golden ornaments that have come down to
us from the early Middle Ages. "Its composition,"
says Herr Luthmer, "is extremely clear and conscious.
An eagle, of heraldic form, it is true, but not with any
of that unnatural emaciation peculiar to the later style
of heraldry, fills the inner circle of a flat ring of stamped
gold enriched with beaded filigree, which at its upper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span>
end&mdash;in order to give space for the head of the bird&mdash;is
not closed, but connected by a curve in the circle of
wire. The eight flowers inserted in the open-work of
the ring, as well as the whole form of the eagle with
the exception of the claws, are filled with cloisonn&eacute;
enamel which unfortunately has disappeared from the
body of the eagle, where only the punctured outlines of
the feathers are perceptible upon the plate of gold.
Otherwise the enamel, made of translucent green and
blue, turquoise-blue, white and yellow, has been preserved
in all its freshness."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This pectoral dates from
the commencement of the twelfth century, and is one
of the chief treasures in the rich collection of antiquities
preserved in the Mainz Museum.</p>

<p>Jewels of this species and of this period are of the
utmost rarity. Another very beautiful example was
discovered at Mainz just five years after the Eagle
Fibula, and is now in the collection of Baron von
Heyl zu Herrnsheim at Worms. It is formed of repouss&eacute;
gold, and represents an eagle standing upon a
branch rolled up at both ends. A fine sapphire occupies
the middle of the breast, in the centre of the wings are
emeralds, the tail is set with lapis-lazuli, and the eye
of the bird with a small ruby. This exquisite jewel
dates from the early part of the thirteenth century. It
measures 2&#8539; inches in height and 1&#8541; inches in
width.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
The most remarkable among jewels of about the same
date (the twelfth century) are the splendid antique
cameos already described&mdash;the Cameo of St. Hilary in
the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, and the Schaffhausen
Onyx&mdash;both of which were originally employed as
pectorals or brooches.</p>

<p>A few brooches are attached, as was once the jewel
of St. Hilary, as <i>ex voto</i> on the breast of reliquary
figures, like that of St. Foy at Conques, which still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span>
exhibits an ornament of this kind. A brooch or fermail
(for this latter term is not confined to the ring-brooch),
1&frac34; inches in diameter, which once formed part
of the ancient jewels of the French Crown, is in the
Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Two exceedingly
fine brooches of about the end of the twelfth century,
found at Mainz in 1896 and now in the treasury of the
cathedral, are described by Dr. Schneider in the <i>Jahrbuch
der K&ouml;niglich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen</i>
(Vol. XVIII); and a pectoral or brooch of a similar
form, a large stone in the centre, surrounded by smaller
ones&mdash;to take only one among many examples&mdash;is
represented on the twelfth-century statue of a queen,
probably intended for the Queen of Sheba, from the
west portal of the church of Our Lady of Corbeil, and
now at Saint-Denis.</p>

<p>In the case of original jewels of this kind, it is not
always easy to determine whether they were articles of
adornment for the clergy or the laity, and though those
for ecclesiastical use probably predominate, it is only
when they contain the figured representation of some
religious subject that they can with certainty be identified
as cope-clasps or <i>morses</i>, the French equivalent for
which is <i>mors de chape</i>.</p>

<p>Morses were frequently of extraordinary size. Monumental
brasses and tombstones, especially in Germany,
exhibit many examples. Adalbert of Saxony, who
was administrator of the archbishopric of Mainz, and
died in 1484, is represented on his tombstone in the
cathedral with one measuring more than 7 inches
across. Existing examples vary from 5 to 7 inches in
breadth.</p>

<p>The jewellers of the Middle Ages delighted in
lavishing their utmost taste and skill on morses, which
were of a variety of shapes, and were composed of
every material. Some were enriched with precious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>
stones, including ancient cameos, and others rendered
attractive with coloured enamels.</p>

<p>Several lists of English morses are preserved. In the
inventory of Sarum,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> of the year 1222, gold, silver, and
jewelled morses, <i>firmacula</i>, <i>pectoralia</i>, or <i>monilia</i> (as they
were variously termed in the Middle Ages) are described
at length; in that of St. Paul's,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> drawn up in 1295, there
are no less than twenty-eight; while the inventory of
jewels (<i>jocalia</i>) preserved in York Minster<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in 1500
includes an extraordinarily rich collection of these
ornaments.</p>

<p>Though some were clearly made fast to one side of
the garment, and were hitched to the other by hooks,
or by a pin, like a brooch, they were not always
employed to unite the two sides, but were sometimes
used simply as a decoration upon the front of the
vestment, and perhaps hung there by a chain round the
neck.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Examples to be found in many museums are
pierced with holes, or have loops behind them, showing
that they were sewn to the vestment with purely decorative
purpose.</p>

<p>From the close of the twelfth century champlev&eacute;
enamel upon copper was much employed for the decoration
of morses. In the fourteenth century champlev&eacute;
was largely superseded by transparent enamel on silver
relief (<i>basse-taille</i>), many of the finest specimens of
which were produced in Italy. Two fine morses displaying
this species of work are preserved; the one in
the British Museum<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and the other at South Kensington.</p>

<p>The use of ancient cameos as personal ornaments
has already been mentioned; and there is in the British
Museum a medi&aelig;val intaglio, the finest of its kind, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span>
was used as a morse. It is known as the Crystal of
Lothair, since it was made, in all probability, for
Lothair II, King of the Franks from 855 to 869. It is
a lenticular plaque of rock crystal, 4&frac12; inches in diameter,
engraved in intaglio,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> with the history of Susanna.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Public collections at home and abroad possess a
variety of examples of Gothic morses of exquisite
design. One of the most remarkable of German workmanship
of the fourteenth century is in the Mus&eacute;e
Cluny at Paris;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> while among the finest German
jewels of the fifteenth century must be ranked a morse
of beautiful execution in the Victoria and Albert
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Other noteworthy examples are, three in
the treasury of the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle, one
of them<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> containing a representation of the Annunciation&mdash;a
subject which, judging from the inventories,
appears to have been a very favourite one for the purpose,
particularly in England. Three more are in Paris:
one&mdash;the beautiful morse of St. Louis&mdash;in the Galerie
d'Apollon,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> a second in the Rothschild Bequest<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> in the
Louvre, and a third in the Dutuit Bequest.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In the
Kunstgewerbe Museum at Berlin is a silver-gilt morse
which was made in the year 1484 for Albert von
Letelen, canon of Minden, by the goldsmith Reinecke
van Dressche of Minden. It is a circular disc 5&frac12; inches
in diameter, filled with three elaborate Gothic tabernacles,
each containing a figure. Entirely symmetrical
in composition, it follows a design commonly found
on the seals of the same date (<a href="#PLATE_XXII">Pl. XXII, 3</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span>
An excellent idea of the extraordinary beauty of
the morses in use at the close of the Middle Ages can
be obtained from fifteenth-century paintings, particularly
of the Flemish school. Few of the latter can
surpass what is one of its finest examples in the
National Gallery&mdash;Gerard David's beautiful picture of
the "Canon and his Patron Saints," in which are displayed,
in almost all their pristine freshness, some of
the most magnificent representations of the jeweller's
art.</p>

<p>Besides these pectorals, which sometimes served a
practical, but often a purely decorative purpose, there
were various other ornaments that acted as clasps
(<i>agrafes</i>). These <i>agrafes</i> are similar to those still made
use of in our day, working on a system of a hook
fitting into a loop. Clasps for mantles were sometimes
made of massive loops fastened on either side of the
border of the mantle, like parts of a hinge, which could
be clasped by a pin being thrust through them, or
by a cord or strap.</p>

<p><a name="img140" id="img140"></a></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption1">Mantle clasp (portion) on effigy of Henry IV
(Canterbury Cathedral).</span>
</div>

<p>A heavy ornamental mantle was often worn by both sexes over the
dress. It was open in front, and displayed the dress underneath. Upon
its opposite edges were fixed two ornamental
rosettes or lozenges, connected by cords terminating in
tassels, or by a band across the breast. In the case of
ceremonious attire this band was of metal, profusely
jewelled, while the ornamental pieces or clasps at each
end were of elaborate goldwork set with precious stones.
On the monumental effigy of Henry IV in the Chapel
of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, at Canterbury Cathedral, the
cloak is secured by a rich band fastened at each end by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span>
diamond-shaped clasps of fine design. Henry's Queen,
Joanna of Navarre, who lies beside him, has clasps of
almost the same form, fixed near the shoulders, and
united by a simple band. Somewhat similar ornaments,
rosette-shaped, can be seen on the effigy of Anne
of Bohemia, first wife of Richard II, in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>Since the pectoral is sometimes worn together with
these clasps, it is evident that it often had nothing to
do with closing the mantle; but when a pin is attached
behind, and it is employed for secular purposes, it
assumes the ordinary type of the modern brooch.</p>

<p>The English word for this smaller and secular
variety of morse, which is distinct from the fermail or
ring-brooch, was <i>nouch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It was also called <i>ouch</i>, by
misdivision of <i>a</i> nouch as <i>an</i> ouch, and was variously spelt
<i>nuche</i>, <i>nowche</i>, <i>owche</i>, etc. That the nouch is the
actual English equivalent to the morse or pectoral is proved
by a will dated 1400,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in which among the jewels bequeathed
to the shrine of the Head of St. William of
York was "unum monile, Anglic&egrave; nouche auri, cum
uno saphire in medio, et j. dyamand desuper, et circumpositum
cum pereles et emeraudes." Nouches were
attached to the front of the garment, but were occasionally
worn upon the shoulder. On the effigy of Henry II,
at Fontevraud, and on that of Henry III<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> in the Chapel
of Edward the Confessor at Westminster Abbey, the
mantle in each case is fastened upon the right shoulder
with a brooch of this kind.</p>

<p>It would be an almost impossible task to describe
all the motives selected for the English brooches of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, their numerous compositions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span>
of human figures and animals of all sorts, and
the various stones with which they were set. The old
inventories give endless descriptions, but hardly any
actual examples, apart from the ring-brooches and
William of Wykeham's magnificent nouch at New
College, have survived. In the British Museum is a
silver-gilt brooch in form of St. Christopher leaning on
his staff and bearing the infant Saviour on his shoulder.
It is of fifteenth-century workmanship, 2&frac34; inches long,
and was found at Kingston-on-Thames (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX, 7</a>).
This brooch is of peculiar interest, since in the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> that worn by the "Yeman" is described as
"A Crystofre on his brest of silvyr shene."</p>

<p>Brooches and nouches, mentioned frequently in the
English inventories of the fourteenth century, became
even more numerous and elaborate in the century
following. Foreign influence, strong at this period, left
its imprint upon all works of art; and the most extensive
commerce was carried on with Flanders, which was then
the workshop of the world. Yet though the following
descriptions of brooches drawn from the inventory of
Henry IV in the Inventories of the Exchequer<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> show a
striking similarity to the continental jewels of the same
date, there is no reason to suppose that these were not
actually produced in England by English workmen.
Five nouches, probably very similar in form to the
splendid jewel at New College, Oxford, and dating
approximately from the same period, are thus recorded:
"Item v. nouches de letres M apparellez de perles et
diverses peres de petit value." Other brooches exhibit
a variety of forms: "Item i. g<sup>a</sup>nt nouche dun griffon
seisant un deyme ove i. saphir en my lieu iij. baleys et vi.
grosses perles"; "Item i. nouche [dor] ove i. damoysell
es blancz flours portant i. papingey en la mayn
apparellez ove i. baleys iij. saphis iij. troches de perles
ove trois diamantz contrifaitz." Similarly enriched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span>
jewels have for their subjects: "i. enfant dor et i. blanc
deime enaymellez"; "i. damoisell et i. unicorn [dor]";
and "un damoisell seant en un solaill." Finally we
meet with the following entry: "Item i. nouche d'un
aungell blanc tenant en sa mayn un saphir feble garnisez
de vi. perles enterfoiles."</p>

<p>Of all the immense wealth of jewellery of the Dukes
of Burgundy in the fifteenth century almost every vestige
has disappeared, and the public museums of the Continent
are practically destitute of Flemish-Burgundian
jewellery of this date. Yet the British Museum, through
the generosity of the late Sir A. W. Franks, is in fortunate
possession of several exquisite examples, which were
dredged a few years ago from the bed of the River Meuse.
The most remarkable is a gold brooch of delicate workmanship,
the centre of which is occupied by a female
figure: a garland encircles her head, a flower set with
a small triangular diamond adorns her breast, while her
hands hold in front a large faceted sapphire. Around,
in the midst of foliage, are three cabochon rubies, and
the settings of other stones and pearls which have
disappeared (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX, 11</a>). The form of this
jewel is peculiarly
interesting in comparison with the above-quoted
<i>aungell tenant en sa mayn un saphir</i> of the inventory of
Henry IV. A smaller circular brooch of similar <i>fabrique</i>
has a diamond above and a pale ruby below, and is encircled
by radiating buds of flowers, the centre of each
bud being formed of a ball of white enamel.</p>

<p>Of the few examples of jewels of similar character
that exist at the present day upon the Continent, there
is in the treasury of the Collegiate Church of Essen
in Rhenish Prussia, amongst several fine objects of the
goldsmith's art, a remarkable and comparatively unknown
collection of enamelled jewels of the fifteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Each of the sixteen objects of the series
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span>
possesses what appears to be a characteristic of most
jewels of this date&mdash;that is to say, it is enclosed by an
encircling wreath-like ornament of the naturalistic late
Gothic style formed of a circular tube of gold to which
are affixed leaves of stamped gold, enamelled and enriched
with pearls. The centres of the jewels are
occupied by a variety of motives. Seven are of a
purely formal composition, enriched with small white
flowers, the stalks of which, covered with green enamel,
resemble with their interlacing design the necklace worn
by Maria Portinari in the Van der Goes triptych at
Florence. The remaining and more elaborate jewels
contain enamelled figures of men and animals executed
with extraordinary minuteness and vivacity. The finest,
and on the whole the best preserved, has in the centre a
female figure in full relief clothed in a white robe and
long green cloak and a head-dress in the form of leaves.
She is seated in a field sewn with flowers in the manner
of the pictures of the period, and behind are golden rays<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
(<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX, 9</a>). The figure upon another jewel
has a somewhat
similar background. Her robe is white, and her
head-dress and the edges of her wing-like sleeves red.
In front of both figures is a small cluster of precious
stones. Though all the objects in this remarkable
collection are of about the same date, they differ
sufficiently to make it clear that, like the treasures from
Saragossa, they owe their presence here to the devotion
of perhaps more than one wealthy person to a highly
revered shrine. In spite of the fact that the majority
are considerably damaged, they are yet eloquent proofs
of the magnificent style of living at the period of their
production, and valuable examples of the ornaments of
the Middle Ages of which no other collection possesses
so large and choice a variety.</p>

<span class="caption1">Brooch of the Virgin in<br />
Lochner's "Dombild"<br />
(Cologne Cathedral).</span>
</div>

<p>In date one is disposed to place these brooches (or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span>
nouches, as they would be termed in old English
inventories) in the first half of the fifteenth century&mdash;at
least as far as the figured pieces are concerned, for
jewellery in pictures of the second half of the century
is mostly formed of pearls and precious stones alone.
Jewelled brooches of this kind ornamented with figures
in relief are particularly well represented in the works
of the older German painters and above all those of
Stephan Lochner (d. 1451), in whose masterpiece in
Cologne Cathedral, known as the
"Dombild," the Virgin is seen wearing
on her breast a brooch ornamented
with clusters of pearls and the figure of
a seated maiden, with a unicorn resting
one foot on her lap.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In another celebrated
picture by Master Stephan&mdash;the
"Virgin of the Rose-Arbour," in the
Cologne Museum&mdash;the same subject is
represented on the <i>mandorla</i>, or almond-shaped,
brooch which closes the Virgin's
robe; while in a third picture by him in
the Episcopal Museum of the same city&mdash;a
picture which, like the rest, bears
traces of Flemish influence&mdash;the Virgin's
brooch or morse is ornamented
with a female figure seated, full face, after the manner
of the British Museum and Essen brooches.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Such is the extraordinary quality and extreme rarity
of jewels of this type that attention must be drawn to
yet two more examples: one in the Imperial Collections
at Vienna, and the other in the Carrand Collection in
the Bargello at Florence. The former is a jewel of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span>
quite remarkable character. Within the usual circle
of gold wire is a pair of lovers standing side by side
each holding the end of a wreath. The figures, dressed
in Burgundian costume of the fifteenth century and
enamelled with various colours, breathe the spirit of
the medi&aelig;val <i>amourette</i> as represented upon ivory
mirror-cases and jewel-caskets and in miniatures of
the twelfth to the sixteenth century. Between them is a
triangular diamond set like the example in the British
Museum, and below it a pale cabochon ruby. Around
are five pearls (<a href="#PLATE_XX">Pl. XX, 8</a>).<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The jewel at Florence
(2 inches in diameter) has a border of green enamelled
leaves set with pearls, and in the centre a finely modelled
figure of a dromedary in white enamel. This brooch,
which is in splendid condition, was perhaps intended to
be worn, as were some other of these pieces, as an
<i>enseigne</i> on the hat or cap (<a href="#PLATE_XVII">Pl. XVII, 12</a>).</p>

<p>Whatever may have been their nationality, a glance
at each, from those in the British Museum to the one
last described, is sufficient to determine the identity of
their source of inspiration. All bear the stamp of the
Flemish-Burgundian art, which throughout the fifteenth
century dominated the creations of the goldsmiths, as
well as the sculptors, miniaturists, and tapestry workers,
of the entire west of Europe.</p>

<p>Every one of these brooches is worthy of the most
careful examination, particularly by the craftsman of the
present day, for unlike the ornaments of more ancient
times, they possess qualities which render them peculiarly
appropriate to the circumstances of our later
civilisation. In the refinement and simplicity of their
arrangement and design these medi&aelig;val examples of
the jeweller's art transcend many of the greatly admired
and more famous jewels of the Renaissance.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL RINGS AND BRACELETS</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>F all classes of medi&aelig;val jewellery finger rings
have been preserved in the greatest number.
Among the various causes that have contributed
to this result must be reckoned their very general use
in former times, their comparatively small value, which
often saved them from the melting-pot and the fact
that they were almost the only articles of value usually
buried with the dead.</p>

<p>As regards the use and form of the finger ring
during the Middle Ages, we find that it retains in the
main its primitive symbolical character, being employed
as an emblem rather than an ornament, to signify the
investiture of office, the binding of the nuptial bond,
and especially as a signet. Though the occurrence of
numerous rings without a seal or other mark proves
their general acceptance as purely ornamental articles,
so deeply was the spirit of the age imbued with leanings
towards the mysterious and the occult, that nearly
every ring is an <i>annulus vertuosus</i>, supposed to be
endowed with some talismanic or sanative efficacy.</p>

<p>For convenience sake medi&aelig;val rings may be
separated into four main divisions: (1) ecclesiastical
and devotional rings; (2) charm rings; (3) love and
marriage rings; and (4) ornamental rings, including
signets.</p>

<p>Rings have always been looked upon with favour
by the Church; they were worn regularly by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span>
higher clergy, and formed part of their ecclesiastical
insignia. The British Museum, by the bequest of
Mr. Octavius Morgan, possesses an important collection
of gilt bronze finger rings of enormous size, each
set with a foiled glass or crystal. Most of them bear
on the hoop symbols of the four evangelists, the Ox,
Lion, Angel, and Eagle, as well as the triple crown and
crossed keys with the arms of various popes, and
sometimes those of contemporary rulers, mostly of the
fifteenth century. These so-called papal rings, of
which other examples, and duplicates, exist, are believed
to have been presented or sent by popes or
cardinals as emblems of investiture when conferring
an office or dignity (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 10</a>).</p>

<p>A jewelled ring was always worn by a bishop,
and was an essential part of his costume when
pontificating. It was specially made for him, and
usually went with him to the grave. Hence it happens
that many of these rings have survived, and are preserved
both in museums&mdash;the collection in the Franks
Bequest in the British Museum being the most extensive&mdash;and
in the cathedrals where they have been
found.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In the earliest times bishops usually wore
engraved rings for use as signets, but they seem to
have had a large jewelled one as well for ceremonial
use. According to the instructions of Pope Innocent III
in 1194, the episcopal ring was to be of solid gold set
with a precious stone on which nothing was to be cut;
hence the thirteenth-century rings are at times somewhat
rudely fashioned, with the shape of the bezel adapted to
the gem just as it was found, its surface merely being
polished. Among the stones usually chosen for the
purpose were the ruby indicating glory, the sapphire
purity, the emerald tranquillity and happiness, and
crystal simplicity. Antique gems in earlier times were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span>
also worn, and on some rings an inscription is added to
give a Christian name to the pagan figure; but others
were merely regarded as ornaments without meaning,
like one dating from the twelfth century in the Waterton
Collection, which bears a Roman cameo in plasma
of a female head in high relief; or like the curious
example found in the coffin of Seffrid, Bishop of
Chichester (d. 1151), in which is mounted a Gnostic
intaglio. The most usual form of ring, and one which
seems to have been reserved chiefly for bishops, is of a
pointed or stirrup shape. It is commonly found set
with a small sapphire, more rarely with an emerald,
and sometimes, as in William of Wykeham's ring at
New College, with a ruby (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 1</a>).
The fashion
for this type appears to have lasted from the thirteenth
to the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The episcopal ring was formerly worn on the
right hand, but is placed at the present day upon
the annular finger&mdash;the third finger of the left hand.
Not more than one episcopal ring is now worn, but
on sepulchral effigies and early pictures bishops are
represented with three or four rings on the right
hand, not infrequently upon the second joint of the
fingers, and also upon the thumb. They were generally
worn over the gloves, the backs of which were ornamented
in addition with a large jewel. These rings
were often, therefore, of considerable size, so that when
worn without a glove a guard-ring was necessary to
prevent their falling off.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Mitred abbots were allowed
to wear the ring; by others it might be worn, but not
during the celebration of the Mass. The use of a ring
was forbidden to the lower clergy.</p>

<p>Among the rings to be classed under the heading of
religious or devotional rings, the most important are the
so-called iconographic rings, that is, those which have on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span>
the bezels, or on the shoulders, which are generally
grooved or fluted, figures of the Virgin and Child, or
of patron saints. They are nearly all of the
same style of workmanship and date almost
exclusively from the fifteenth century. They
are peculiar to England and Scotland. Several
examples are preserved in the National Museum
of Antiquities at Edinburgh (p. 104), and others
in the three great English ring collections.</p>

<p>Devotional rings of the same date, and
mostly of English workmanship, have broad
hoops, some engraved with sacred monograms,
some with holy names such as <span class="smcap">jesus</span>
and <span class="smcap">maria</span>, and others with the names of the
Three Kings, spelt in all manner of ways. Two exquisite
English gold rings of this kind, dating from the first
half of the fifteenth century, are in the British Museum.
One, found at Coventry in 1802, is engraved with the five
wounds of Christ, together with the legends describing
them, and on the inside an inscription containing the
names of the Three Kings of
Cologne (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 4, 5</a>).<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
The other ring was dug up at Godstow Priory, near
Oxford, and is of small diameter, suited for a lady's
finger, but has a broad hoop engraved with sacred
figures. It appears to have been employed as a love
ring, for within the hoop is an inscription which runs
thus:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="images/inmynd.png" width="414" height="15" alt="inscription" title="" />
<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 6</a>).</p>

<p>Another form of religious or devotional ring which
was sometimes used in place of the ordinary rosary
of beads was the decade ring. This was so called from
its usually having at intervals round the hoop ten knobs
which were used for repeating ten Aves, and a head or
bezel for the Paternoster.</p>

<p>Finger rings, to an even greater extent than any
other species of medi&aelig;val jewellery, were designed to act
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span>
as talismans or amulets; and they served, more than
any other purpose, that of charms. Their virtue was imparted
sometimes by the stone, and sometimes by the device,
inscription, or magical letters engraved upon them.</p>

<p>The mystic virtues attributed to stones as well as to
engraved gems during the Middle Ages has been frequently
alluded to. Among the different stones (like the
sapphire, for instance, the very word for which implies
protection against drunkenness) carried in the bezel of
the ring, which were supposed to make the wearer proof
against evil influences, the most valued was the toadstone
(<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 9</a>). It was supposed to be found in
the head of a toad, but is in reality the fossil palatal tooth
of a species of fish&mdash;the ray. A toadstone&mdash;also known
as crapaudine and batrachites&mdash;in a ring was said to indicate
the presence of poison by perspiring and changing
colour. Toadstones were much sought after, and were
highly prized, even in Shakespeare's day.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Sweet are the uses of adversity;<br />
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,<br />
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head. <span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>As you like it</i>, II, 1.)</span></div></div></div>

<p>Ben Jonson alludes to the custom of wearing the
stone in rings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Were you enamour'd on his copper rings,<br />
His saffron jewel, with the toad-stone in't? <span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>Volpone</i>, II, 5.)</span></div></div></div>

<p>In addition to the stones already mentioned, greatly
valued was the Turkey-stone or turquoise, as the
"Compassionate turcoyse, which doth tell, By looking
pale, the wearer is not well." (Donne, <i>Anatomie of
the World</i>.) It was his turquoise ring which Shylock
would not have lost "for a wilderness of monkeys."</p>

<p>The use of charm rings seems to have been not
uncommon in early times. It was one of the articles
of impeachment against Hubert de Burgh, the great
justiciar of Henry III, that whereas the King had in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span>
his treasury a ring which rendered the wearer invincible
in battle, his minister furtively removed the
same and bestowed it upon Llewellyn of Wales. As
charm rings, too, must be reckoned those which enclosed
small relics. But rings so used seem for the
most part to have been worn attached by a ribbon or
chain to the neck, and not on the finger.</p>

<p>Since such highly valued objects as charmed stones
could only be obtained by a few, cabalistic inscriptions
often took their place. Many of the devotional rings with
the names Jesus, Mary, and Joseph engraved on them,
were used as a preservative against the plague; but the
most popular inscription was, as has been seen, the names
of the Three Kings of the East, which were a powerful
charm against peril by travel and sudden death. Such
rings were worn against the cramp. There were also
caract rings of superstitious use, which bore charms in the
form of inscriptions, such as <span class="smcap">ananizapta.</span>
Many other
rings of this class have cabalistic names and strange
barbaric words and combinations utterly unintelligible.</p>

<p>The <i>fyancel</i> or wedding ring appears to be of
Roman origin, and was usually given at the betrothal
as a pledge of the engagement. Two forms of these
rings are the "gimmel" and the "posy" rings.
Gimmel rings (French, <i>jumelle</i>, a twin) are composed of
two hoops forming, when closed, one ring, and so constructed
as to play when open one within the other.
They are of two sorts: those which are either plain or
set with precious stones, and those which have the
device of the <i>fede</i> or two right hands joined.</p>

<p>Inscriptions or mottoes, as a rule in Norman-French,
are to be found on rings of the fourteenth, and
more frequently on those of the fifteenth century.
They were called "chansons" and also "resons" or
"reasons," and later, poesies, posies, or posys. These
love inscriptions, generally engraved on the outside
of the ring (though placed inside in the sixteenth and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span>
seventeenth centuries) are for the most part the same
as those found on the brooches of the time, inscriptions
such as <i>Je suis ici en lieu d'ami</i>, and the like, being
of frequent occurrence. More rarely the motto is in
English, as on the beautiful iconographic gold ring in
the British Museum. New Year's Day among the
Romans was a <i>dies faustus</i> and objects of jewellery
were usually among the presents which it was the
custom to exchange on that occasion. In the Middle
Ages also the advent of the New Year was celebrated
by the bestowal of presents. Among these <i>estrennes</i>
jewellery was a prominent item, and on the rings of
the period (like the one figured on p. 150) the inscription,
<i>en bon an</i> frequently occurs.</p>

<p>A very extensive group of medi&aelig;val finger rings is
formed by signets. These are marked with some device,
such as an animal, a bird, a tree, or any other object,
so that they could be easily recognised; hence they were
often given as credentials to a messenger. In the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries rings of silver, and occasionally
of gold, occur, with a crest or coat-of-arms, or
with devices in the form of initials, and certain arbitrary
signs called merchants' marks, which were used by
merchants and others not entitled to armorial bearings.
Piers Plowman speaks of "merchantes merkes ymedeled
in glasse." Such rings were often worn on the thumb.
Though armorial signets were worn in Italy as early
as the fourteenth century, they were not common in
England till the commencement of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar are certain devotional signet rings
of silver or base metal engraved with an initial&mdash;generally
the letter I surmounted by a coronet. The
I is probably the initial of the Saviour's name, such
rings being worn from a belief in the efficacy of holy
names as preservatives from evil.</p>

<p>In connection with the medi&aelig;val use of ancient
engraved stones, the fashion of wearing Roman intaglios
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span>
in rings has already been noticed. Upon the
metal setting around these gems a legend in Latin was
often engraved; the most usual inscription being
<span class="smcap">sigillum secreti, sigillum meum</span>, or the word <span class="smcap">sigillum</span>,
followed by the name of the owner (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 11</a>).</p>

<p>Rings which have the appearance of being purely
ornamental were worn throughout the Middle Ages in
considerable numbers both by men and women; yet at the
same time it must ever be borne in mind that the stones
set in them had probably in the eyes of the possessors
a value quite independent of their use as ornaments.</p>

<p>In the Gold Ornament Room of the British Museum
is a collection of five English rings of silver of the
twelfth century. They are of small intrinsic value, but
of considerable interest as authenticated examples of
ornamental rings of the period; for with the exception
of those found on the fingers of prelates, the date of
early rings is sometimes difficult to determine. The
rings were dug up at Lark Hill, near Worcester, in
1854, together with upwards of two hundred pennies of
Henry II. They probably date, therefore, from about
the end of the century.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<span class="caption1">French gold ring, fourteenth
century (Louvre).</span>
</div>

<p>The peculiarity of many of the richer ornamental
rings of this period is the tendency to
place the stone upon a high case or
stalk, so that the bezel is raised considerably
above the hand. A curious
example, dating from the fourteenth
century, is in the Sauvageot Collection
in the Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre.
It shows two dragons' heads issuing
from crown-shaped ornaments supporting
a sapphire in a high collet.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century a large
number of rings appear to have been habitually worn;
and on the monument of Lady Stafford in Bromsgrove
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span>
Church, Worcestershire (1450), every finger but the last
one on the right hand is decorated with a ring. In many
of the Flemish pictures of the same date we find ornamental
rings set with table-cut or cabochon stones. The
form of these is admirably represented in the portrait
of a goldsmith, ascribed to Gerard David, in the Royal
Gallery at Vienna. In his right hand he holds one ring,
and in the left a short roll of parchment, on which are
placed four more. The rings are somewhat massive,
and thicken towards the bezel, where they are mounted
with table-cut stones within plain claw settings. In
the same gallery is John van Eyck's portrait, dated 1436,
of John De Leeuw, jeweller to Philip the Good, Duke
of Burgundy. He holds between the thumb and forefinger
of his right hand a gold ring set with a small
cabochon stone.</p>

<p>This notice of medi&aelig;val finger rings may be concluded
by drawing attention to a picture which, in view
of the jewellery of the Middle Ages, is one of the
most fascinating of all the productions of the Flemish
school. The panel in question, the property of Baron
A. Oppenheim, of Cologne, represents the legend of
St. Godeberta and St. Eloy. It was painted in the
year 1449 for the corporation of goldsmiths of Antwerp
by Petrus Christus, who flourished in the first half
of the fifteenth century, and died at Bruges about
1472. Appropriately enough, the patron saint of goldsmiths
is figured in his shop; and the picture thus
affords us a singularly interesting and attractive representation
of the interior of a jeweller's shop in the
middle of the fifteenth century with every detail of its
glittering contents. St. Eloy or Eligius, whose figure,
for all we know, may be the portrait of some well-known
jeweller of the day, is seen seated at the goldsmith's
bench, beside which stand Dagobert, King
of France, and St. Godeberta. He is employed in
weighing the ring with which the King seeks to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span>
espouse the Virgin Saint; but instead, so the legend
runs, of giving her the engagement ring, he slipped on
her finger a ruby ring, mystically espousing her to
Christ. The King wears, pinned to the front of his
black chaperon, a brooch or enseigne, set with a ruby
surrounded by four pearls and having a pendent drop.
Round his neck is a curb chain of alternate plain and
beaded links, from which hangs a jewel formed of two
lions <i>affront&eacute;s</i>. Godeberta's head-dress, or <i>escoffion</i>,
is of embroidered gold sewn with pearls. The pendant
of her neck-chain, hidden by the bodice, lies between
the breasts.</p>

<p>Very carefully rendered is each item of the choice
collection of objects that forms the goldsmith's stock-in-trade,
exhibited on a stall covered with white linen
on the left hand of the goldsmith-saint. Below is a
box of rings, some plain, some mounted, ranged along
three rolls of parchment. Beside them lie large pearls
and precious stones, and seed pearls sorted in a shell
by themselves. Behind, against the back, rest a branch
of coral and oblong pieces of rock crystal and of opaque
stone of porphyry-red. Above, on a piece of dark
cloth, hang three splendid jewels&mdash;a pendant and two
brooches, and next to them a pair of tooth-like pendants,
probably glossopetr&aelig;. From the shelf on the
top is suspended a string of red, amber, and pale blue
rosary beads, and in the middle a girdle end of brown
leather with buckle and mounts of gilded metal. The
remainder of the collection, formed of various vessels,
comprises a crystal cylinder set with gold and precious
stones and a mounted cocoanut cup; and on the upper
shelf a covered cup and a couple of tall flagons of silver
parcel-gilt. This remarkable picture at once brings to
mind that strangely interesting series of interiors afterwards
produced by Quentin Matsys and Marinus van
Romerswael, representing money-changers, bankers, or
usurers busily engaged in counting up or weighing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span>
coins scattered before them on a table, upon which also
sometimes lie a handsome ring or two, a richly jewelled
pendant, or unset precious stones and pearls.</p>

<p class="center"><b>BRACELETS</b></p>

<p>Bracelets were as little in vogue as earrings during
the Middle Ages, and remarks made concerning the
latter apply also to bracelets, in that they only appear
as the lingering traces of Byzantine fashions which,
until the commencement of the twelfth century, made
themselves strongly felt throughout the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>In the National Museum at Munich is a gold armlet
formed of two hinged halves covered with filigree
and beaded ornament. Its outer rims are of twisted
gold, and within are bands of fine plaited wire. It is
adorned with bosses of filigree alternating with pyramidal
projections. The origin of this fine ornament is
unknown, but it probably dates from about the eleventh or
twelfth century (<a href="#PLATE_XVIII">Pl. XVIII, 6</a>).
The National Museum
of Buda-Pesth contains a pair of very similar armlets.
In connection with these ornaments the persistence of
tradition in goldsmith's work is curiously seen, since
armlets closely resembling the earlier examples are made
and worn in Cairo at the present day.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the Middle Ages it appears
to have been a common practice for ladies to wear
rosaries or chaplets of beads upon their wrists as bracelets.
With these exceptions, the long sleeves that were
worn throughout the greater part of the Middle Ages
did not favour the use of an ornament that demanded
the bare skin as a foundation. Ornamental circlets
round the upper arm, which are not infrequently met
with in pictures, must be regarded as gold-embroidered
edgings or bands. It is true they were frequently set
with pearls, stones, and decorations in gold, but as
they were sewn upon the sleeves they have no actual
claim to the name of armlets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span>
Armlets or bracelets appear to have been worn to
a certain extent towards the close of the fifteenth
century, but to have been reserved chiefly for summer
wear. "If the bracelets we ordered months ago are
not here till the summer is over and we no longer
wear our arms bare, they will be of no use." So,
about 1491, says Mrs. Ady, wrote the famous Isabella
d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua, to the skilled goldsmith,
Ercole Fedeli, of Ferrara, who had failed to
execute her order punctually. The dilatoriness of the
same artist on another occasion kept the marchioness
waiting four years for a pair of silver bracelets, and
they would never, she declared, have been finished in
her lifetime if Duke Alfonso had not thrown him into
the Castello dungeon.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Though there are other references to the use of
bracelets in the fifteenth century, it was not until about
the middle of the century following that this species of
ornament came into general use.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p class="center"><b>MEDI&AElig;VAL BELTS AND GIRDLES</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE girdle or <i>ceinture</i> of elaborate workmanship
formed no inconsiderable part of the jewellery
of the wealthy in the Middle Ages. Though
actual examples are extremely rare, there is scarcely an
effigy or picture from the thirteenth century to the beginning
of the sixteenth which does not supply us with
some varied form of this indispensable article; while the
wills and inventories of the period often contain descriptions
of girdles of extraordinary richness. By the poor,
too, the girdle was habitually worn, but with them it
frequently dwindled down to a few metal knobs sewn
on to leather or on to coarse cloth.</p>

<p>In addition to the upper girdle for fastening round
the waist, a lower girdle was worn, both as an ornament
and as a belt for the sword. It was a broad and
sometimes stiff band which loosely encircled the body
about the hips, and in the case of male attire was
sometimes attached to the lower border of the tunic,
with which it converged.</p>

<p>Of the narrower and more pliable species of girdle,
the portions reserved for special enrichment were the
ends, one of which terminated in the buckle, and the
other in the pendant or <i>mordant</i>. Some account of the
buckle and of its plate, to which the strap of the girdle
is attached, has already been given in the Introduction.
Always a favourite field in former times for the display
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span>
of the jeweller's art, it was likewise richly adorned by
the goldsmiths of the later Middle Ages. At the other
end of the girdle was a metal attachment or chape
which gave it consistency where it was most required.
This girdle end, which hung down and was known as
the tag or pendant, was decorated with various designs
frequently of an architectural character and sometimes
set with precious stones; but whenever such decorations
projected beyond the sides of the strap the buckle
was made wider in like manner, and if tassels and
other ornaments were added they were always of such
size that they could pass easily through the buckle.
The metal shape thus covering the end of the belt was
also called the <i>mordant</i> (of the same derivation as the
word morse), especially if in the absence of a buckle it
was so constructed as to hook on to a clasp to facilitate
securing the belt round the person. The mordant
often forms with the buckle-plate a single design, its
decorated front being either as large as the plate, or
of such a shape as to form with it a regular figure.
From the twelfth century, when from sepulchral
monuments<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
we obtain our first information respecting the
girdle, until the seventeenth, we nearly always find
that the end, when passed through the buckle, was
twisted round the waist-strap and hung down in front,
in the case of men about twelve inches and with women
almost to the ground. But when, instead of a buckle,
a clasp formed of a central stud or rosette was employed,
either the end of the girdle itself hung down,
or an additional chain was attached at the point
of junction. To this was sometimes suspended a
pomander-box, tablets, or a pendent reliquary. This
mode, however, of suspending such objects did not
come generally into vogue till the time of the Renaissance,
and when worn in the earlier period at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span>
girdle they were hung at the side from a hook, somewhat
like a chatelaine.</p>

<p>The girdle itself was usually about two yards in
length, and consisted of a strap of stamped leather, or
a band of material with a firm foundation, upon which
were set button-shaped decorations at regular intervals.
This was known as the studded girdle (<i>ceinture ferr&eacute;e</i>).
Among the wealthy the studs were composed of the
precious metals, against which the sumptuary laws both
at home and abroad (of little effect it would seem) contained
special prohibitions. The studs upon the girdles
of the poor were generally of the alloy of brass and tin
called latten or laton, and the term "pearled with
latoun" is mentioned in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.</p>

<p>There is still in existence in the City of London
the Girdlers' Company, which is of great antiquity.
By a charter granted them by Edward III in 1327
it was forbidden to the girdlers to "garnish any girdle
of silk, wool, leather or linen thread, with any inferior
metal than latten, copper, iron, and steel, and if any
girdles were garnished with lead pewter, or tin, the
same should be burned, and the workmen punished for
their false work."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In spite of this prohibition girdles
appear to have been frequently mounted with the baser
metals, and a considerable number with mountings of
pewter have been discovered. Their ordinance, as did
that of latoners or workers in latten, likewise forbade
girdlers from interfering with the trade of the goldsmiths
by mounting girdles or garters with gold or
silver; and that if a girdler wished to <i>harness</i> his
goods with either of the precious metals he was obliged
to employ a goldsmith. In 1376 a girdler of the City
of London was accused of "having secretly made in
his chamber a certain girdle that was harnessed with
silver." Upon being brought before the justices he
pleaded that his offence was a light one compared with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span>
the more serious fraud of plating with silver objects of
base metal. He was dismissed with a warning. Subsequently
he was convicted of the very fraud he himself
had mentioned, and punished with a heavy
fine.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The
work of the English goldsmiths in the adornment of
girdles appears to have been well known and recognised
upon the Continent, and an inventory of the jewels of
the Duke and Duchess of Orleans in 1408 mentions a
girdle of rich goldwork set with pearls and sapphires
"<i>de la fa&ccedil;on d'Angleterre</i>."</p>

<p>The medi&aelig;val girdle, seldom as in later times in
the form of a chain, but generally composed of leather,
was sometimes ornamented in the most costly manner.
In the inventory of Edward II is "a girdle in the old
style [probably filigree-work] set with letters of pearls:
the buckle and mordant enamelled with escutcheons of
the arms of England and
others."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In the expenses
of the Great Wardrobe of Edward
III<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> there occurs an
entry of 304 dozens of silver buckles, and a similar
number of pendants, while his jewels deposited in the
Treasury included many complete girdles enriched
with enamels and precious
stones.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> From the many
fifteenth-century girdles of extraordinary richness described
in the inventories, the following, the property
of Henry IV, may be selected as an example: "Item,
a girdle of black silk, of gold, garnished with various
stones. With 28
bars<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> of gold, 13 of which are set
with 13 balasses, and 4 pearls at the corners, and 14
bars, each enamelled with various flowers, and on each
4 pearls. Set on the buckle is one balas, 10 large and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span>
6 small pearls. On the pendant one balas, 8 large and
5 small pearls."</p>

<p>This entry probably refers to the broader and richer
kind of girdle, known as the military belt
(<i>cingulum</i>);<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
a similar belt being also worn by women. It was
generally employed by men, as was sometimes the
narrow girdle, for the purpose of hanging the sword.
This belt, frequently composed of silk or gold tissue,
seems to have come into general use about the fourteenth
century, and was worn round the hips. It was
often furnished with a buckle and mordant, but was
more usually united by a clasp, which at times was made
very prominent, and assumed excessive dimensions.
Girdles and belts in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries were sometimes studded with medallions of
Limoges enamel. There is in the Victoria and Albert
Museum a beautiful fifteenth-century Italian belt of gold
tissue (<a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Pl. XXXVIII, 1</a>). Its buckle,
studs, and other
ornaments are of gilt metal, and the broad buckle-plate
is enriched with niello work, bearing the legend
<i>Virtus vin</i>[<i>cit</i>]. Two silver-gilt plates from a Gothic
girdle of Flemish work of the fifteenth century are in
the possession of Herr James Simon, of Berlin. Each
plate is almost square, and measures 1&frac34; by 1&frac12; inches.
The centres are sunk: within one is a figure of Samson
and the Lion, and in the other a figure on horseback,
probably St. George or St. Michael. The figures, in
full relief and delicately modelled, are each surrounded
by pearls and blossoms, the groundwork being covered
with bright green enamel, on which are small dots
of white enamel capped with red. The plates are
ornamented at each corner with chased Gothic foliage,
and have hinges at the sides to unite them to other
similar sections, of which the complete girdle was,
perhaps, originally composed (<a href="#PLATE_XXV">Pl. XXV, 4</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span>
Of frequent occurrence in old English wills is the
word <i>demysent</i> (or <i>demysens</i>), which refers to the little
girdles worn by women: they were known in France
as <i>demi-ceints</i> or <i>demi-ceintures</i>. Another species of
girdle was called the <i>baldrick</i>&mdash;derived from the French
<i>baudrier</i>; the <i>baudroier</i> being the currier who prepared
skins for the purpose. The term baldric or baudric,
sometimes applied to the military belt worn round the
waist, was generally employed for a belt worn over one
shoulder, across the breast, and under the opposite
arm.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It was often of a rich description and set
with precious stones, and in early times was occasionally
hung with little bells.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Among the girdles in the possession of Henry
IV<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
one is garnished with heads of stags and small pearls,
and another with ostrich plumes and little golden bells.
Others, mostly of stuff, are garnished with various
flowers, mostly roses, or with ivy leaves, and the
majority are hung with little bells. In addition to such
enrichments, which included also coats-of-arms, girdles
bore inscriptions, engraved on the buckle-plate, or
formed of letters sewn upon the band. These latter
were often of an amatory or of a superstitious character;
for, like other articles of medi&aelig;val jewellery, the girdle,
on account of the stones, etc., set upon it, was frequently
considered endowed with talismanic properties.
Chaucer in his adaptation of the older "Roman de la
Rose" describes the rich jewelled girdle, worn by one
of the emblematical characters in the Garden of Love.
It was set with stones evidently valued for their mystic
properties.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span></p>

<p>Attached directly to the girdle or suspended from it

of velvet, silk, or stamped leather. The gipci&egrave;re (also
written <i>gypcyre</i>) is mentioned most frequently in early
documents, where it is often described as being enriched
with embroidery, and set with pearls and precious
stones. Like the aulmoni&egrave;re and escarcelle, it was
worn from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century hung
from a loop at the right side of the girdle. The heads
or clasps of the finest purses were of beautiful workmanship,
of silver, bronze, or iron, damascened, or
exquisitely chiselled. For ordinary use these heads&mdash;known
as gipci&egrave;re <i>beams</i>&mdash;as well as the mounts or
frames of the purses, were made of brass or latten;
and judging from the number that has been found and
preserved, in the Guildhall Museum, for instance, their
use must have been very general in medi&aelig;val times.</p>

<h2>RENAISSANCE JEWELLERY</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<p class="center"><b>ITALY, FIFTEENTH CENTURY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE history of Renaissance jewellery in general
may be approached by reviewing the condition
of Italian jewellery in the fifteenth century. In
the foregoing outline of European jewellery to the end
of the fifteenth century&mdash;which has served as an
approximate date for the termination of the medi&aelig;val
epoch&mdash;practically no reference has been made to Italy.
One need only examine the general style of Italian
painting, architecture, and sculpture of the Quattrocento,
to see how far apart the art of Italy stands from that
of the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>Italian jewellery certainly merits the great reputation
it has always possessed. Nor is this surprising,
considering the prominent part played by the goldsmiths
in the renaissance of artistic taste&mdash;by these
craftsmen who, in the highest sense artists, were the
first to break the fetters of tradition, and yield to those
impulses that sought a wider field for the gratification
of their creative instinct. Hence the history of the
jeweller's art in Italy at the period of the Quattrocento
largely resolves itself into the biographies of those
master sculptors and painters, who worked first as
goldsmiths and jewellers, and throughout their careers
remained ever mindful of their original trade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span>
Venice, which in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
was the wealthiest city and the principal port in
Europe, though rivalled in the former century by
Bruges and by Antwerp in the latter, encouraged the
use of luxurious jewellery, as did the great cities of the
north. But Florence undoubtedly took the lead as an
artistic centre, judging alone by the artists she produced.
The paintings of the Venetian school (the
work of Crivelli, for instance), and those of the schools
of Tuscany, etc., reveal the exquisite beauty of ecclesiastical
jewellery, and of the ornaments with which
men, no less than women, loved to deck their persons.
Nearly every painter possessed an insight into the
mysteries of the goldsmith's craft, and represented his
subject, whatever it might be, with careful attention to
its jewelled accessories. The great merchants of
opulent and artistic cities, such as Siena, Milan, and
others, besides Venice and Florence, delighted in rich
jewels; and the masters of the schools of painting
which had their centres in these towns have preserved
in glowing pigment a faithful record of these delicate
works of art, on which the eminent jewellers of the day
lavished their skill and ingenuity.</p>

<p>The great superiority and beauty of the personal
ornaments revealed to us in this manner must first of
all be ascribed to that awakening to the full joy of life
that was so characteristic a feature of the Renaissance.
The rapture of spring ran hot in men's veins. Life
was an uninterrupted succession of revelry and gaiety,
amid splendour of colouring and glitter of gold. The
goldsmith emerges from the subordinate state he occupied
in the medi&aelig;val guild, and attains fame as a free
artist, whose duty was to minister personally to the
luxurious tastes of those who played a part in the
gorgeous pageant of the new epoch. The goldsmiths
included among their ranks great master craftsmen,
whose perfection of technical skill seemed to find satisfaction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span>
only in overcoming the greatest problems that
their art could offer.</p>

<p>Vasari tells of the very close connection and
almost constant intercourse that existed between the
goldsmiths and the painters. Indeed, nearly every
artist, before applying himself to painting, architecture,
or sculpture, began with the study of the goldsmith's
craft, and "passed the years of his apprenticeship in
the technical details of an industry that then supplied
the strictest method of design."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The names of several artists of the Renaissance
have been handed down who are specially recorded as
having worked at jewellery. One of the earliest of
those who began their career in the goldsmith's workshops
is Ghiberti (b. 1378), who throughout life remained
faithful to that species of work. His jewellery
is specially extolled by Vasari.</p>

<p>Following upon Ghiberti were two great jewellers,
Tommaso (commonly called Maso) di Finiguerra and
Antonio Pollaiuolo; the former famous for his nielli,
the latter for his enamel-work upon relief. Pollaiuolo's
love for jewel-forms in his paintings (executed together
with his brother Piero) is seen not only in the Annunciation
at Berlin, but in the group of SS. Eustace,
James, and Vincent in the Uffizi, and the portrait of
Simonetta Vespucci at Chantilly. Born in 1435, a few
years after Pollaiuolo, Andrea del Verrocchio resembled
in the peculiar versatility of his genius, others of these
typical artists of the Middle or High Renaissance&mdash;the
Epoch of the Goldsmith it has been termed.</p>

<p>A jeweller whose influence in his own day was
greater, and whose fame almost equalled that of
Cellini, was Ambrogio Foppa, called Caradosso, who
was born about 1446 at Milan. He worked first in
the service of Ludovico Sforza, and afterwards at
Rome, where he died as late as the year 1530. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span>
seems to have been skilled in every branch of the goldsmith's
art, and especially excelled in making little
medallions of gold, enriched with figures in high relief
and covered with enamels, which were worn as enseignes
in the hat or hair. His work in this direction
is highly extolled by Cellini, and his skill in enamelling
specially mentioned by Vasari.</p>

<span class="caption1">Pendant worn by one of The
Three Graces in Botticelli's "Primavera."</span>
</div>

<p>Among the artists of the end of the fifteenth century
who, after being goldsmiths and jewellers, became
celebrated as painters must be mentioned Botticelli
(1444-1510), Domenico del Ghirlandaio (1449-1494), and
Francia (1450-1517). Ghirlandaio is commonly referred
to as a maker of the jewelled coronals (<i>ghirlande</i>),
popular with the unmarried and newly wedded ladies
of Florence. It is probable that he did produce this
class of work in early life; but his name seems to have
been borne by several members of his family, for in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a goldsmith was
often familiarly termed "Ghirlandaio," as one of his
chief occupations was the manufacture of the rich
head-ornaments then so much in vogue.</p>

<span class="caption1">Jewel, in Ghirlandaio's portrait
of Giovanna Tornabuoni.</span>
</div>

<p>Though Ghirlandaio does not fill
his pictures with dainty details like
the intricate settings which Botticelli
devised for the neck-pendants of the
Graces in his "Primavera," yet he
invariably pays careful regard to the
representation of jewelled accessories.
Such may be seen in the well-known
portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni
(1488), belonging to Mr. Pierpont
Morgan (formerly in the Kann Collection).
She has two jewels: one,
worn on her breast, is formed of a ruby in claw setting
with a small beryl above, and hung with three pendent
pearls; the other, specially introduced into the picture and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span>
lying beside her in a recess, is composed of a cluster of
stones&mdash;a ruby surrounded by two pearls and three
beryls&mdash;beautifully set, and surmounted by
a winged dragon with a sapphire
over its head. Resting upon a table
in the foreground of another picture&mdash;a
curious panel in the possession
of Mr. George Salting&mdash;representing
Costanza de' Medici, are several
pins, three rings on a roll of parchment,
and a pendant hung with
three pearls and set with a large
and a small sapphire. In the Pitti
Gallery is a portrait, not by Domenico,
but by his son Ridolfo
Ghirlandaio, which may be here
alluded to owing to the special
interest of its subject. The portrait is that of a
jeweller holding in his hand and gazing intently at
what is presumably one of his own creations&mdash;a richly
enamelled jewel fashioned in the form of a "pelican
in its piety."</p>

<p>Concerning the jewellery of the great goldsmith of
Bologna, Francesco Raibolini, called Francia, a considerable
amount of information has been preserved.
Born in 1450, he passed the best part of his life as
a goldsmith, and not till he was upwards of forty did he
abandon the goldsmith's art for that of the painter.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
One of Francia's finest paintings is the "Felicini" altar-piece
in the Bologna Gallery, executed in 1484 by commission
of Messer Bartolomeo Felicini for the church
of S. Maria della Misericordia in that city. Among the
many splendid gifts this famous church had received
was a jewel which the records say was set by Francia
himself. Its beauty was held in such esteem, that by
desire of the chapter the artist introduced it into his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span>
picture, where it can be seen hanging over the head
of the Madonna. Its centre is occupied by a fine
amethyst, and is bordered by deep blood-crimson
enamel, with pearls at the angles. So carefully is
every detail of this jewel painted, that a modern goldsmith
has found no difficulty in copying it with absolute
exactness<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> (<a href="#PLATE_XXV">Pl. XXV, 1</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The last of the great jewellers of the Quattrocento
was Michelagnolo di Viviano, who worked at
Florence under the patronage of Lorenzo and Giuliano
de' Medici. He was the earliest instructor of the
greatest goldsmith and jeweller of the late Renaissance,
Benvenuto Cellini, in whose <i>Treatise</i> and <i>Life</i> he is
spoken of with the highest praise.</p>

<p>From actual examples we obtain but slight information
of the Italian ornaments of the fifteenth century;
but that there is a distinct alteration in the style of
jewellery between the Quattrocento and the Cinquecento,
the pictures of these great artistic periods offer
abundant proofs. This difference is particularly noticeable
in ornaments for the head. During the fifteenth
century we find the forehead heightened, and the space
thus obtained emphasised by a single jewel placed at the
top of the brow. This form of ornament is admirably
shown in Piero della Francesca's "Nativity" in the
National Gallery, and particularly in his "Madonna
and Child," with saints and angels, and with the
donor, Federigo of Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino,
in the Brera, Milan. The parts of these two pictures
most characteristic of the artist are the figures of the
angels, who wear jewels executed with extraordinary
brilliancy&mdash;compositions of pearls in delicate goldwork
enriched with blue enamel. Precious stones
and jewels were often sewn, at regular intervals, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span>
round the band of ribbon or galloon that encircled
the head, as seen in a portrait in the Ambrosiana, Milan,
ascribed to Ambrogio da Predis, and considered to be
that of Beatrice d' Este; but it is more usual to find in
the centre of the brow an isolated jewel, held by a narrow
ribbon or silken cord, knotted at the back of the head&mdash;as
in Caroto's portrait of the Duchess Elizabeth Gonzaga
in the Uffizi, who wears on the forehead a jewelled
scorpion, emblem of logic.</p>

<p>This head-ornament is known as the <i>ferronni&egrave;re</i>;
and the origin of its title is somewhat peculiar. There
is in the Louvre an attractive and greatly admired
portrait of a lady, with her hair held in place by
black cord supporting a diamond in the middle of the
forehead. For many years the portrait was entitled
"La Belle Ferronni&egrave;re," having been erroneously considered
to be that of the blacksmith's wife (ferronni&egrave;re)
whose beauty enthralled Francis I in his declining
years. It is now generally held to be a portrait
of Lucrezia Crivelli, mistress of Ludovico Moro, Duke
of Milan. The name of the painter is a matter of
dispute, though the work is still ascribed, as it has
long been, to Leonardo da Vinci. At the beginning of
the nineteenth century, when the Romantic movement
was at its height, a similar ornament was revived, and
received its present name under a misconception of the
subject of the picture. In the sixteenth century this
simple ornament is abandoned, and it was the painter's
task to depict magnificent coiffures like those of
Veronese's ladies, sprinkled with jewels and entwined
with ropes of pearls.</p>

<p>As regards the ornaments for the neck, the changes
of fashion in the two periods and the artistic mode of
expressing the fashion demanded a different style of
jewellery. The slender neck which is displayed in the
portraits of the earlier period required lighter ornaments
than did the massive forms of the later. "The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span>
artist no longer trifled with single gems, hanging on a
thread, but painted a solid chain, and the light, close-fitting
necklace becomes pendent and heavy."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The
distinct refinement exhibited in Italy in the fifteenth
and early sixteenth centuries did not demand a great
profusion or variety of jewellery. As the pendent
ornament for the neck-chain, a simple jewel formed by
one stone in the centre and smaller stones or four pearls
around seems in most cases to have been sufficient.
Circular pendants of niello-work surrounded by silver-gilt
bands of corded ornament were much in use, and a small
number, dating from about 1460 to 1530, have survived.
They sometimes bear a religious subject (<a href="#PLATE_XIX">Pl. XIX, 4</a>).
But not infrequently the head of a lady is represented
in profile, generally with a flower under her nose; and
it is possible that these were worn by men as a pledge of
affection from their lady-love. Finger rings with somewhat
similar designs were also worn (<a href="#PLATE_XXIII">Pl. XXIII, 16</a>).</p>

<p>Beyond a small number of objects of this description,
very few examples of Italian Quattrocento jewellery
have escaped the crucible. The change of taste even
between the early and the full Renaissance was sufficient
to cause their destruction. Among surviving
jewels of this century is a very beautiful gold and
enamel pendant in the collection of Mr. Pierpont
Morgan. It is circular in form, and was probably
intended as a reliquary. Upon the front is an Annunciation
in high relief. The garment of the Virgin is
enriched with red and blue, and that of the angel with
red and white enamel; the chequered base being of
translucent green. Around is a border of leaves and
flowers enamelled red and white. The open-work back
consists of a central rosette, surrounded by interlacing
curves, and edged with a delicate wreath (<a href="#PLATE_XXV">Pl. XXV, 2</a>).</p>

<p>It remains to draw attention, by means of a beautiful
representation of jewellery in painting, to an example
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span>
of the style of brooch worn in Florence in the
latter part of the fifteenth century. The picture referred
to is that of the Virgin and Child (No. 296) in the
National Gallery. It is apparently the work of Verrocchio,
Pollaiuolo, or one of the goldsmith-painters of whom we
have spoken; for the minute
execution of the ornaments
would seem to denote the hand
of an artist who had practised
the goldsmith's and jeweller's
art. The brooch that serves as a
fastening for the Virgin's cloak&mdash;the
same being represented
on that of one of the angels&mdash;is
of most charming design. It has in the centre
a table-cut ruby, around which are set four pearls
between ornaments in the form of blackberries, surrounded
by an outer border of blackberry leaves.
So carefully is the jewel drawn that every detail can
bear close inspection. A peculiar point of interest is
that the pearls, each of which is set in a couple of
crutch-like clasps, appear to correspond to the "perles
&agrave; potences" frequently mentioned in the contemporary
jewel inventories of the Dukes of Burgundy.</p>

<span class="caption1">Brooch worn by the Virgin in fifteenth-century
Florentine picture (No. 296, National Gallery, London).</span>
</div>

<p>Some measure of compensation for the unfortunate
lack of actual examples of Italian Quattrocento jewellery
is obtained, apart from their representation in pictures,
by the very remarkable use that was made of jewel
forms for the marginal decoration of manuscripts.
Such enrichments of the borders of missals, etc., by
means of painted jewel ornaments, would seem to be
but the direct outcome of the system whereby most of
the painters, sculptors, architects, and no less eminent
miniaturists received their first instruction in art in the
workshops of the goldsmiths. It is certain from their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span>
quality that the jewels represented in manuscripts,
generally in their natural size, are the work of artists
well acquainted with the jeweller's art, whose eyes were
further impressed by the embroidered edgings of
ecclesiastical vestments enriched with jewel ornaments
and sewn with pearls and precious stones. In painting
with corresponding luxury the border decorations of
church missals, the miniaturists have obviously not
drawn on their imagination, or constructed jewel forms
in a mere haphazard manner. The individual pieces,
often complete jewels, are just such as might at the time
have been found on the shelves of some goldsmith's
workshop.</p>

<p>Among the most skilful of such reproductions of
jewels are those in the celebrated choir books of the
cathedral of Siena, particularly the pages painted by
Liberale di Giacomo da Verona, who worked at Siena
from the year 1466. An examination of these illuminations
reveals Liberale as an artist thoroughly conversant
with the jeweller's craft: so that his work,
together with that of his followers, such as the Florentine
Giovanni di Giuliano Boccardi, the Dominican Fra
Eustachio, Litti di Filippo Corbizi, Monte di Giovanni,
Antonio di Girolamo, the famous Attavante, and the
various miniaturists of King Mathias Corvinus of
Hungary, apart from its charming execution, constitutes
a veritable storehouse of information respecting the
ornaments of the period. Particularly fine examples
of jewelled and enamelled decorations are also contained
in choir books in the cathedral of Florence,
missals in the Barberini Palace, Rome, a Bible of
Mathias Corvinus in the Vatican Library, several books
in the Brera at Milan, and the fine Glockendon missal
(<i>circa</i> 1540) in the Town Library at Nuremberg. More
important perhaps than all is the Grimani Breviary,
now in the Library of St. Mark's, Venice. The ornamentation
of this famous work, the product of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span>
Flemish artist of the final years of the fifteenth century,
displays a northern naturalism favourable to the striking
representation of jewel forms, and serves to illustrate
the close and active relationship then existing
between the Flemish and Italian goldsmiths.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p class="center"><b>SIXTEENTH-CENTURY JEWELLERY (GENERAL)</b><br />
<b>ITALY, SIXTEENTH CENTURY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">G</span>REAT ostentation and external splendour were
the chief features of the Renaissance. So, if
the jewellery of this time appears to us more
magnificent than that of any other, this superiority is
but an indirect result of the intermediate causes which
find a place in all that is included under the term
Renaissance.</p>

<p>In enumerating certain characteristics that distinguish
sixteenth-century jewellery from that of other
epochs, the enormous quantity used may first of all be
noted. A general increase in wealth had taken place,
but in the comparative rarity of opportunity for investments,
it was still customary to keep gold and precious
stones secreted,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> or, as was more generally done, make
them into ornaments of small compass and easily convertible
into hard cash.</p>

<p>Coupling this with the magnificent style of living
during the Renaissance, we need feel less surprise at
the extraordinary abundance of jewellery which we
read of in contemporary chronicles, and find represented
in the utmost variety on the portraits of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span>
period. Men of solid reputation and serious disposition
seem, equally with women, to have fallen victims
to the reigning passion for jewellery.</p>

<p>If we are at first inclined to wonder at the number
of Cinquecento jewels that have survived, we can more
readily understand that they represent the merest fraction
of what formerly existed, when we take into consideration
all the risks of destruction such fragile and
precious objects have undergone&mdash;objects by their
nature the very first to disappear. Monetary pressure
caused by war, the division of property, and many
other events were fraught with danger to objects in the
precious metals. Change of taste, almost as rapid as
that in dress, which has caused the last fashion but one
to be the least of all desired, necessitated the repeated
refashioning of jewellery. Notwithstanding their perfection,
the exquisite productions of the sixteenth
century were unable to resist the fatal influence of
fashion, and were largely broken up towards the termination
of the seventeenth century, when brilliant enamels
and artistically wrought gold were less in request, and
the precious metals became entirely subservient to the
stones, for which they acted simply as settings. On
the other hand, their small size, which has rendered
them easy to conceal, accounts for the preservation of
some examples, while mere chance, or perhaps an
historical association, oft-times solely traditional, has
saved others from destruction.</p>

<p>The finest productions of the artificers of antiquity
transcend in abstract beauty of design everything,
perhaps, that has since been produced. Those of the
medi&aelig;val craftsmen possess a charm and beauty impossible
to deny, and a peculiar <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and ingenuousness
of their own, to be looked for in vain elsewhere. It must
be acknowledged, however, that the jewels of the Renaissance,
the receptacle of every variety of adornment
by way of precious stones, pearls, and enamels that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span>
goldsmith could devise in order to enrich them, are in
their own manner incomparable. It may be that some
err so far on the side of over-elaboration that they lose
the balance and dignity of harmonious design, but the
majority possess qualities rarely found in combination
save at this remarkable period&mdash;a richness of form,
boldness of conception, and extraordinary refinement
of technique. There is no species of technical work,
whether it was a case of hammering, chasing, or
casting, or, above all, enamelling, that was not then
brought to perfection. But the splendours of the Renaissance
must not blind us to the efforts of the
preceding age; for thorough though the change was
from the style of Gothic art, the jewellers of the Renaissance
were deeply indebted to the medi&aelig;val traditions
which they had by their side to aid them in
developing their artistic conceptions.</p>

<p>Another noticeable point with regard to the jewellery
of this period is its astonishing variety. Its
decline, and reduction to a monotonous repetition of
design, coincides with the disappearance of those artists
who possessed the universality of a man like Cellini,
and with the division of labour characteristic of modern
art and industry.</p>

<p>In addition to the enormous quantity used, a distinctive
feature of Renaissance ornaments is the preference
shown for colour. The placing together of
bright-coloured gems with delicately worked gold
invariably enriched with polychrome enamels is the
fundamental motive of the jewellery of the period. So
admirable was the craftsman's taste that each jewel
forms in itself a scheme perfect in design and colour,
and the rubies, emeralds, and sapphires introduced for
the sake of their colour values, serve the composition as
a whole without overwhelming it; while the diamond,
which comprised almost the sole material of the jewellery
of later times, was used only for purposes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span>
contrast. It cannot be said that precious stones had
entirely forfeited their medi&aelig;val reputation at the
period of the revival; but as jewellery was beginning
to assume generally the character of mere ornament,
the stones which enriched it were naturally chosen
rather with an eye to their decorative qualities than for
any fancied virtues they might be considered to possess.</p>

<p>One of the charms of this old jewellery lies in the
setting of its stones, which are mostly table-cut, and
fixed in square pyramidal collets. The usual process
of setting was to rub the upper edges of the closed and
box-like collet over the setting edge of the stone, and
occasionally to lay over this an additional ornament in
imitation of claws. This manner of beating up or
pressing the edges of the collet over the faceted sides
of the stone is extremely pleasing, for the stone, with
its colour thrown up by a foil or <i>paillon</i>, harmonises
admirably with the somewhat irregular frame of gold
that surrounds it.</p>

<p>The art of enamelling, especially where figures are
represented in full relief, attains the highest point of
perfection. Even when enamels cover the various parts
of jewels in a wondrous harmony of colour, the artists
of the period contrived with extraordinary tact to leave
small portions in gold: the hair of the figures, manes
of horses, armour, weapons&mdash;glittering points that enhance
the beauty of the whole. Translucent and
opaque enamels are found side by side employed in
different modes with astounding assurance. Extensive
use was made of opaque white enamel, always by way
of contrast; a favourite device being to enrich with it
the edges of tendrils in the form of minute beads, each
no larger than a pin's head.</p>

<p>It is the desire for harmony and beauty of execution,
rather than for display of wealth, that characterises the
best productions of the Renaissance, whose true value
lies not in their intrinsic, but in their real artistic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span>
worth. The whole of every jewel, back as well as
front, is finished and enamelled with the same exquisite
care. What little material value these jewels possessed
when their form and design was destroyed and their
beautiful devices obliterated is well illustrated by
Brant&ocirc;me's story of the jewels of the Countess of
Ch&acirc;teaubriand. This lady had been supplanted in the
affections of Francis I by another&mdash;the future Duchess
of Estampes&mdash;who persuaded the King to claim all the
fine jewels he had bestowed on his former mistress.
The value of these lay chiefly in their beautiful designs
and devices, so on receiving the demand, she melted
them all down, and returned them to him converted
into golden ingots.</p>

<p>The splendid love of life which finds expression in
every production of Renaissance art exercises a pervading
influence over its jewellery, and determines the
subjects to be represented. All the larger objects, and
indeed every object which is not of a purely decorative
pattern, is given to the depicting of a subject. Throughout
the finest period of jewellery, goldsmith's work was
closely associated with sculpture; and the human figure,
or figures of animals either real or imaginary, wrought
in relief or executed in the round, find a place on
almost every jewelled composition. The subjects,
largely chosen from among the new circle of ideas
opened up by the literature of the Renaissance, reveal
wide knowledge of classical mythology, romance, and
poetic legends, as well as remarkable adaptive genius.
Nor are subjects from the Old and New Testaments
excluded; though fanciful groups&mdash;in one case a representation
of some theological virtue, and in another
some sacred allegory&mdash;are more popular. The symbolical
figures of the Middle Ages, as the unicorn and
the "pelican in her piety," with sea monsters and fantastic
men and beasts, are of frequent occurrence.
Subjects such as these, and many others suggested by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span>
the fertile mind of the Renaissance jeweller and the
artist who drew his designs, are so numerous that
space would fail were one to attempt to enumerate even
a tithe of those met with on jewels of the Cinquecento.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its subjects, we find in the jewellery
of the Renaissance, beyond what tradition had
preserved, no direct influence resulting from the study
of the ornaments of the ancients, though the awakened
interest of Italy in the antique cannot but have been
accompanied by some acquaintance with the productions
of her early goldsmiths. There appears, however,
to have been no attempt to base the jewels of the
period on the forms of ancient ornaments, to imitate the
beaded work of the Etruscans or the goldwork of ancient
Greece or Rome.</p>

<p>Yet Renaissance design of the sixteenth century,
with its arabesques and scrollwork (best represented by
Raphael's famous arabesques in the Loggia of the
Vatican) seems to have been in the main inspired by
antique designs, such as the frescoes discovered at
Rome in 1506, in the Baths of Petus&mdash;the so-called
grottos, from which was derived, as Cellini explains,
the term grotesque.</p>

<p>The newly developed design, a combination of
figures, masks, flowers, fruits, and various other
details, applicable as it was to every branch of art,
was peculiarly adapted to jewellery, and was quickly
seized upon by the jewellers, who employed it for ornaments
of a purely decorative formation, or for the
framework or backgrounds of the exquisite figured compositions
then so much in vogue.</p>

<p>The real difficulty that confronts one in dealing
with the jewellery of the sixteenth century lies not in the
inability to obtain the necessary material examples,
but in expressing a definite opinion as to their nationality
and origin; and this difficulty the best informed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span>
and most experienced connoisseurs are the first to confess.
The utmost, therefore, that one can hope to do,
without attempting in every case to arrive at accurate
conclusions, is to indicate, as far as possible, such means
as may be of assistance in ascribing a nationality, not
to all, but to at least the majority of Renaissance ornaments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>ITALY, SIXTEENTH CENTURY</b></p>

<p>Italian jewellery of the sixteenth century presents
what is probably one of the most difficult
problems in the whole history of the art. In the
fifteenth century the almost complete absence of examples
necessitates recourse mainly to pictures; but
Italian pictures of the sixteenth century are of comparatively
small assistance, from the fact that Italian
painters of that period mostly neglected the preciosity
of style and delicacy of perception that studied the
gleam and shimmer on jewels and such-like objects.
The bright blending of beautiful colours had to give
way to strong shadows and skilful effects of perspective.
There exists, on the other hand, an abundance
of material in the form of actual specimens of Cinquecento
jewellery, but owing to the far-reaching influence
of the Renaissance style of ornament a decision as to
their precise provenance is a matter of the utmost
difficulty.</p>

<p>The great popularity of one of the central figures of
the late Renaissance&mdash;Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1572)&mdash;has
for many years caused the finest examples to be
attributed to him or to his school, often with complete
disregard of their design, which can be traced in many
cases to another source. It is unnecessary to give
a biographical account of the famous Florentine
goldsmith, for his life may best be studied in his own
memoirs. More to the present purpose is it to attempt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span>
to estimate the real position that Cellini should occupy,
especially with regard to such examples of jewellery as
have come down to the present day.</p>

<p>Upon the question of Cellini the artistic world has
long been divided into two camps. The majority of
those who have previously dealt with the subject have
considered it sufficient to sum up the whole history of
the jeweller's art of the sixteenth century under the
name of this one artist, and to attribute everything
important to him. The lively and singularly attractive
narrative of his own life and adventures contains such
candid glorification of himself and his work, that the
temptation is strong to follow the majority, and, unmindful
of his contemporaries, to associate with him,
as he himself has done, the finest jewellery of the
whole Renaissance. Eug&egrave;ne Plon, for example,
Cellini's chief exponent, in his magnificent work,
<i>Benvenuto Cellini, Orf&egrave;vre, M&eacute;dailleur, Sculpteur</i>
(1883), though eminently just, and on the whole fair
in his attributions, cannot disguise an evident desire to
ascribe to the Florentine goldsmith, or at any rate to
his school, not only several jewels which might conceivably
be associated with Cellini, but also several
others of more doubtful origin. Among these is the
important group of jewels in the Rothschild Collection
in the British Museum, known as the Waddesdon
Bequest, the real origin of all of which is held by
those best entitled to judge to be incontestably German.</p>

<p>Cellini's critics, on the other hand, sceptical, and in
the main dispassionate, have placed him under a more
searching light, and despoiled him of the halo with
which his own memoirs have encircled him. He remains,
however, an excellent and many-sided artist,
thoroughly versed in all the technicalities of his craft,
and one who without doubt strongly influenced his
contemporaries. Admirable goldsmith and jeweller as
he certainly was, he is entitled to the highest distinction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span>
but not so much on account of the references in
his <i>Vita</i> and <i>Trattati</i> to his own productions, as for his
lucid treatment of technical questions.</p>

<p>"Artists," says Mr. Symonds, "who aspire to immortality
should shun the precious metals." Despite all
that has been said respecting such jewels as the <i>Leda and
the Swan</i> at Vienna (<a href="#PLATE_XXIX">Pl. XXIX, 5</a>), the <i>Chariot of Apollo</i>
at Chantilly, and the mountings of the two cameos,
the <i>Four C&aelig;sars</i> and the <i>Centaur and the Bacchic
Genii</i> in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris, which
have, with some degree of likelihood, been attributed
to Cellini, the only quite authenticated example of his
work as a goldsmith is the famous golden salt-cellar at
Vienna. This object when looked at from the goldsmith's
point of view, in the matter of fineness of
workmanship and skill in execution, is seen to possess
particular characteristics which should be sufficient to
prevent the attribution to Cellini of other contemporary
work, created by jewellers who clearly drew their inspiration
from entirely different sources.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to affix a nationality to existing
jewels, the only really serviceable landmarks are those
furnished by the collections of engraved designs by German
and French masters of ornament; and when these are
compared with the contemporary work just spoken of, the
common origin of nearly all becomes at once evident.
Bearing in mind the skill and fame of the Italian goldsmiths,
not only of Cellini, but of his contemporaries,
such as Girolamo del Prato, Giovanni da Ferenzuola,
Luca Agnolo, and Piero, Giovanni, and Romalo del
Tovaloccio, the reason why the vast majority of extant
jewels should follow German designs is difficult to
understand. An authority no less reliable than Sir
A. W. Franks has expressed an opinion that the
designs of D&uuml;rer, Aldegrever, and other German artists
were extensively used in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Italian goldsmiths did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span>
not produce any such examples of engraved ornament
for jewellery as did their confr&egrave;res in Germany, France,
and Flanders; but the current knowledge we possess
of the art of the period renders it at least unlikely
that the individuality which is the key-note of
all the productions of the Italian Renaissance would
have countenanced there, in Italy, the use of extraneous
ready-made designs. Certainly artists of the stamp of
Cellini would not have used them. One is forced
nevertheless to acknowledge the possibility of minor
Italian craftsmen having executed jewels from German
engravings. The international character visible on so
many art objects of the time must be attributed in no
small degree to the circulation of such designs in
almost all the workshops of Europe.</p>

<p>A reason for the many difficulties that arise in connection
with this particular question seems to lie in the
fact that for causes unexplained the jewellery of the first
half of the sixteenth century, whether Italian, German,
or of other nationality, has almost all vanished,
and that examples met with at the present day belong
chiefly to the second half of that century. While
acknowledging the existence of a fair number of jewels
whose authorship cannot be otherwise than Italian, and
without denying the possibility of the survival of
examples of jewellery even from the hand of Cellini
himself, a protest must be raised against the practice,
hitherto so common, of describing <i>every</i> jewel of the
sixteenth century as Italian, and of coupling <i>every</i> high-class
object of this description with the magic name of Cellini.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</b><br />
<b>GERMANY, THE LOW COUNTRIES, HUNGARY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HOUGH introduced early into Germany, the
style of the Italian Renaissance made its way
but slowly in a country where the ideas of the
Middle Ages long held possession of people's minds.
It was not till after about 1515, when the spread of
books and engravings quickened its general acceptance,
that the new movement gained ground there. The
German goldsmiths, when once they had cast aside the
Gothic style, seized upon Renaissance ornament with
such avidity that by the second half of the sixteenth
century they had acquired a widespread fame, and
would seem by their richness of invention to have completely
cast into the shade the Italian jewellers of their
own day.</p>

<p>From an early period there had been a steady flow of
artists leaving Germany to study in the great Italian
ateliers. The principal of these, and one who influenced
his countrymen more than any, was Albert D&uuml;rer, who
showed in the engravings produced after his journey
to Italy a perfect apprehension of Italian design. As it
travelled northward, Renaissance ornament increased
in freedom from classic rule, and in the hands of the later
draughtsmen and engravers who executed patterns for
the goldsmiths, it lost much of its original purity, and
assumed a mixed style, composed of strap and ribbon
work, cartouches, and intricate complications of architectural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span>
members; while the industrious affectation of the
jewellers of the day for manipulative difficulties led to
the production of ornaments whose effect is sometimes
marred by over-elaboration of detail.</p>

<p>In addition to other circumstances, we must remember
that the greater wealth of the middle classes was a
powerful factor in the increasing production of jewellery.
The goldsmiths consequently occupied an important
position; and that there was a great demand for their
services is proved by the fact that patterns for jewellery
executed on their behalf by the foremost engravers of
the day form no unimportant part of the engraved work
produced by these artists.</p>

<p>In Germany, as elsewhere, success in trade resulted
in a demand for objects of luxury. The city of Augsburg,
situated on a great trade route, early attained to a
height of commercial prosperity, while Munich, and especially
Nuremberg, not far distant, flourished to an
equal degree. Under the stimulating patronage of
wealthy families, such as the Fugger family of Augsburg,
articles of jewellery of every kind were produced
in abundance, and throughout the sixteenth century
found their way over nearly the whole of Europe.
In addition to these three cities, Prague during the
last few years of the sixteenth and the commencement
of the seventeenth century was likewise a centre for
the manufacture of an immense amount of enamelled
jewellery. This industry, carried on with considerable
activity owing to the influence of the Archduke Ferdinand
of Tirol (1520-1595), brother of Maximilian II,
was most flourishing in the time of the Emperor Rudolph
II (1552-1612), King of Hungary and Bohemia,
under whose patronage several remarkable specimens
of German goldsmith's work now at Vienna were executed,
such as the Austrian Imperial Crown, made in
the year 1602.</p>

<p>The epoch of about forty years that terminated at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span>
the death of Rudolph II in 1612, and known as the
Rudolphine period, witnessed the production, mainly
in Southern Germany, of the greater part of the enamelled
jewellery now extant. Renaissance jewellery,
as we speak of it, may be said to have almost ceased
after that period, at a date which coincided with the
outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, and the
Civil War in England.</p>

<p>Its proximity to Italy rendered Augsburg more
quickly subject to the influence of the Italian style than
Nuremberg and Munich, though by the middle of the
sixteenth century the whole of Southern Germany
followed the style of decoration of the Italian masters
so thoroughly, that it is difficult to assign a large
proportion of the ornaments of the period to either
nation, since the distinguishing feature of the hall-mark
finds no place on jewellery, as on other objects in the
precious metals. It is true that the extraordinary
development of cartouche and strap ornament on
German work, as on that of the Netherlands, serves in
many cases to distinguish it from the Italian, yet there
is sufficient similarity in details of ornamentation, in
masks and figures, as well as in the method of enamel-work
and the setting of gems, to account for the
divergence of opinion that exists as to the provenance
of all the jewels of the period. Such is the glamour
that surrounds Italian art, that it has been the custom
to assign every fine jewel of the Renaissance to Italy;
but a careful examination of existing examples has left
us convinced that by far the greater number of them
are not Italian, but of German origin, and belong to
the second half of the sixteenth century and the early
years of the seventeenth. Portraits, alone, by such
German painters as Wolgemut, Strigel, Burgkmair,
Altdorfer, Hans Baldung Grien, Lucas Cranach, and
Bartholom&auml;us Bruyn, show that by the very commencement
of the sixteenth century the wealth of the merchant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span>
princes of Southern Germany resulted in an even
greater display of jewellery than was indulged in by
the Italians.</p>

<p>Various other considerations contribute to this conviction.
First and foremost is the question of the designs
from which the jewellers drew their ideas. A certain
number of original drawings for jewellery by German
artists exist. Of these there are examples of the work
of the two greatest, namely D&uuml;rer (1471-1528) and
Holbein (1497-1543). To Holbein's drawings, which
were executed in England, detailed reference is made in
a later chapter. In his designs for jewellery, as in all
else, D&uuml;rer, the son of a goldsmith and descended
from one on his mother's side, maintains a high
standard of excellence.</p>

<p>His drawings (as catalogued by Lippmann) include
the following: (1) <i>In the Kunsthalle, Bremen</i>. Three
sketches for pendent whistles, where the sound-producing
part is formed of a ball with a hole in it, into
which the air is carried by a pipe. In two cases the
ball is held in the mouth of a lion, and in the third in
the beak of a cock. The animals stand each on a curved
pipe, and have a ring above for suspension (L. 124).
(2) <i>In the British Museum</i>. Two sketches for ring-shaped
pendants&mdash;apparently whistles (<a href="#PLATE_XXVI">Pl. XXVI, 1</a>).
In both cases is air blown from a mouthpiece half-way
round the ring into a ball held in an animal's mouth
(L. 252). (3) <i>In the possession of Herr von Feder,
Karlsruhe</i>. Four designs for brooches and clasps,
richly ornamented (L. 433-435, and 437). Two of
these sketches (L. 433 and 437) and several others (the
whereabouts of the originals of which is not known)
were etched by Wenzel Hollar in the seventeenth century,
and are enumerated in Parthey's catalogue of
Hollar's works. The etchings after the two known
originals are numbered 2565 and 2561. The other jewels
etched by Hollar from D&uuml;rer's designs are the following:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span>
(1) A pendant in the form of St. George and the Dragon
within a laurel wreath, with a ring above and below
(P. 165). (2) A girdle-end formed of two dolphins with
a chain attached (P. 2559). (3) A buckle and buckle-plate&mdash;the
buckle formed of two dolphins, the plate
ornamented with two cornucopi&aelig; (P. 2560). (4) A round
scent-case or pomander (P. 2567). In addition are
miscellaneous designs for ornaments, erroneously considered
to be patterns for embroidery (P. 2562-3-4 and
2566). A charming representation of a pendent jewel
is seen in D&uuml;rer's woodcut of the Emperor Maximilian's
Triumphal Arch suspended from the Imperial
Crown held by the figure of Genius.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Following D&uuml;rer there appeared a number of goldsmiths
who, with the spread of the new style over
Europe, were prepared to perform the task of remodelling
personal ornaments in accordance with the taste
of the day. The most ingenious of them, together with
some artists of distinction, engraved with great fertility
of imagination, for those who were not capable of design,
patterns for goldsmith's work and jewellery. A large
demand was made on the productive faculties of these
engravers, who included among their ranks not only
the best artists, termed from the usual small size of
their productions "the little masters," but many other
designers of goldsmith's ornament; and from their
works, multiplied by means of engraving, the numerous
craftsmen who worked in gold, enamel, and precious
stones, drew their subjects and ideas.</p>

<p>On the question of the production of jewellery from
such engraved designs, it is interesting to note the
several points of similarity that exist in the procedure
of the ornamentists of the sixteenth century and
that of the English furniture-designers of the eighteenth.
In both cases the original producers of the
designs were practical craftsmen, who certainly executed
objects after their published patterns; while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span>
the patterns themselves were employed extensively as
models. In both cases, too, it is quite evident that in
a number of instances fanciful designs were produced
which were never carried out. Hence one can readily
understand the difficulties that are encountered in
attempting to determine the provenance of such small
and portable objects as personal jewels, the engraved
designs for which were in like manner widely distributed.
But there is the strong probability, after all,
that the greater number of jewels, after engraved
designs of German origin, were executed in, or not
very far distant from the locality in which the designs
originated.</p>

<p>If designs are considered insufficient for the identification
of jewels, there exists a means much more
certain, and one which should surely prevent the attribution
to Italians of jewels unquestionably the work of
German craftsmen. It may be remembered that Cellini
in his <i>Trattati</i>, in dealing with the goldsmith's art,
advised jewellers to preserve castings in lead of their
works in gold and silver. In many cases Cellini's
recommendation has been literally carried out, and a
considerable number of proofs struck by German
jewellers of details of their jewels have fortunately
come down to us. The Bavarian National Museum at
Munich contains a highly important collection of these
leaden casts, being a complete series used by a family
of gold and silver workers in Augsburg for upwards of
250 years (from about 1550 to 1800). The jewellers of
Augsburg were among the first in Europe, and these
models of their productions, bearing strong traces
of the influence of contemporary ornamentists, correspond
in many details with original jewels dating from
those times.</p>

<p>Examples of these lead models for jewellery exist in
other collections, such as the Historical Museum at
Basle. Of the same material but of infinitely higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_193" id="page_193">{193}</a></span>
artistic importance, are the lead models by the hand of
Peter Fl&ouml;tner of Nuremberg. In addition to engraved
designs, Fl&ouml;tner executed models for goldsmiths, carved
in stone and boxwood. From these&mdash;of which original
examples have survived&mdash;casts (so-called plaquettes)
were made in lead, which were used as patterns for
craftsmen in the same manner as engravings of ornament.
Fl&ouml;tner's models, though issued mainly for
workers in gold and silver plate, were employed also
by the jewellers, and exercised considerable influence on
their productions.</p>

<p>Few engraved designs for jewellery are prior in date
to the year 1550, though nearly all the prominent painter-engravers
delighted in exercising their inventive faculty
in this direction. One or two plates of pendants by
Brosamer, and a buckle and whistle by Aldegrever,
represent almost the sole engravings of the kind before
Virgil Solis&mdash;the first to devise a more ambitious series
of jewels. Amongst the earliest is the <i>Kunstb&uuml;chlein</i><a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
or pattern book for goldsmith's work, by Hans Brosamer
(about 1480-1554). These woodcuts, which are singularly
attractive, are of a transitional character, with traces of
Gothic design. They include two pages of pendants
composed of stones between leafwork grouped round
a central ornament and hung with pear-shaped pearls.
One pendant consists of a niche between pillars&mdash;a
similar style of ornament to that adopted by Androuet
Ducerceau, and the first assignable instance, says Herr
Lichtwark,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of the use of architecture in German jewellery
of this time, though this same motive was frequently
represented later on by Erasmus Hornick and Mignot.
Three other pendants are in the form of whistles for
wearing on the neck-chain. In an engraving for a
whistle of a similar kind by Aldegrever (1502-1558),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span>
the lower part is formed of a case containing an ear-pick
and a knife for the finger-nails. Except for this
design (which finds a place in the background of his
engraving of the pair of folding pocket-spoons of the
year 1539), Aldegrever's only example of jewellery is the
remarkable Gothic girdle-buckle with its buckle-plate
and tag (dated 1537). The characteristic fig-leaf ornament
of the early German Renaissance is better represented
here than on any other engraving of the period.</p>

<p>More modern in style is Mathias Zundt (1498-1586),
whose compositions (dated 1551-1554) are carried out
with great fineness. Zundt lived at Nuremberg, his
great contemporaries, Virgil Solis and Erasmus Hornick
being natives of the same city.</p>

<p>It was to Virgil Solis (1514-1562), one of the most
skilful and prolific of the German <i>Klein-Meister</i>, that
the jewellers and other craftsmen of the day owed their
finest inspirations. Virgil Solis's beautiful series of
pendants are executed with great charm and delicacy.
They bear the character of a transition from the graceful
foliage of the early to the full Renaissance, with its fanciful
architectural forms, its scroll ornament, arabesques,
animals, and grotesque human masks and figures (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII, 1, 2</a>).</p>

<p>Erasmus Hornick likewise exercised a potent influence
on the jewellery of the time. He engraved in
1562 a series of pendants, chains, and other jewels of the
most delicate execution (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII, 4-6</a>). The pendants
in form of an architectural niche with the subject placed
in the centre, are the prototype of all the jewels of this
kind which we meet with subsequently in the prints of
the Flemish engraver Collaert.</p>

<p>While many important engravings were being issued
for the benefit of the jewellers of Nuremberg, a great
quantity of jewellery was produced at Munich under
the patronage of the Dukes of Bavaria. Duke Albert V
had as court painter a skilful miniaturist, Hans Mielich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span>
(1516-1573), whom he employed to paint in the form of
an inventory exact copies in miniature of his jewels and
those of his wife, Anne of Austria, preserved in his
treasury. In addition to these drawings, now in the
Royal Library at Munich, are a number of others,
which came into the possession of Dr. von Hefner-Alteneck,
and on his death in 1904 were purchased for
the sum of &pound;2,500 for the Bavarian National Museum.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Though the majority of these drawings for jewellery,
in themselves works of extraordinary beauty, were
copies of objects then already in existence, the presence
of jewels similar to Mielich's designs leads to the
supposition that this artist exercised a strong influence
on the jewellers of his day, and that a number of jewels
were also executed at the command of the Duke from
original sketches of his. None of the actual objects
depicted by Mielich have survived, save a large gold
chain set with pearls, rubies, and emeralds, which corresponds,
particularly in its rich enamel-work, to one of
the drawings lately added to the National Museum.
This chain is known as the collar of the Order of
St. George. The size and quality of its stones and the
great beauty of the enamelled settings render it, without
doubt, the finest article of its kind in existence.
It is preserved in the Royal Treasury (Schatzkammer)
at Munich, together with a number of other objects of
the same type.</p>

<p>The last decades of the sixteenth century saw the
appearance of a new species of ornamental design,
whose chief advocate, Theodor de Bry (1528-1598), of
Li&egrave;ge, with his sons Johann Theodor and Johann
Israel, settled in Frankfort-on-the-Main about 1560.
It is a rich and varied surface decoration, often of white
upon a black ground, composed of scroll ornament
richly set with flowers, fruit, grotesques, and figures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span>
of animals, the whole being charmingly designed, and
engraved with great brilliancy of touch. In addition
to his more famous knife-handles, de Bry executed
several engravings for clasps, buckles, and metal attachments
to girdles.</p>

<p>For the counterpart of the artistic style of de Bry
one must look to the Low Countries and particularly to
the work of the engraver Hans Collaert (1540-1622),
of Antwerp, who developed remarkable fertility in the
production of patterns for jewellery. Collaert's designs
require special attention, because of the tendency, elaborated
largely by him and other engravers of the school of
Antwerp, towards exuberant cartouche ornaments with
a mixture of extravagant and loosely arranged strap-work,
and stud&nbsp;-or boss-work. This style, full of
grotesques and arabesques, pervaded the work of every
craftsman of the day, and dealt a final blow to any
further development of pure Renaissance ornament.
Collaert's chief series of pendants, eleven in number,
published in 1581 under the title <i>Monilium bullarum
inauriumque artificiosissim&aelig; icones</i>, are probably the
best known of all designs for jewellery of this epoch.
One of these engravings, in particular, has been several
times reproduced. It is a large pendant hung from a
cartouche and surmounted by a figure of Orpheus with
a lyre, with two seated female figures. The rest of the
jewel is made up of scroll ornaments and bracket-shaped
terminal figures, and is hung with three drop pearls.
This pendant is of peculiar interest in connection with
its bearing on what has already been said with regard
to the attributions given to Cinquecento jewellery. Two
striking instances of misapplied attributions of this
kind may be quoted. In one<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> work the engraving in
question is described as: "Pendant par Benvenuto
Cellini (Mus&eacute;e de Florence)"; and in another<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> as:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span>
"Geh&auml;nge in der Biblioth&egrave;que nationale zu Paris nach
seinem [Cellini's] Model gearbeitet!"</p>

<p>It has been usual&mdash;while acknowledging the great
influence of these engravings on the jewellery of the
time&mdash;to doubt whether jewels exist which have been
executed in exact imitation of them. To show that
such designs were actually followed, we may point to a
jewel figured by Herr Luthmer in his catalogue of
Baron Karl von Rothschild's collection at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
which follows in every detail the particular
engraving by Collaert just mentioned as having
been ascribed to Cellini. Collaert's influence was
considerable in his day, and his compositions circulated
not only in Flanders, but also in Germany and other
prominent jewel-producing centres. Jewels are repeatedly
met with, which, though they do not follow in
every detail Collaert's published designs, are obviously
inspired by them. A very notable example of such is
a jewel, to be referred to subsequently (p. 247), in form of
a gondola containing figures of Antony and Cleopatra,
which was sold by auction in London for a very large
sum a year or two ago. With Collaert were several
minor designers of jewellery, such as Abraham de
Bruyn (1538-after 1600), among whose engravings are
seventeen models for pendants and portions of jewels in
the style of the admirable French jeweller-engraver
Etienne Delaune. Other Dutch and Flemish engravers
of ornament belong more to the seventeenth century,
and will be dealt with later.</p>

<p>At the furthest corner of Germany from Flanders
was the ancient kingdom of Hungary, where jewellery
was employed in almost Oriental profusion. The native
costume is luxurious even at the present day, and in
olden times the nobility made a practice of attaching to
it a great part of their fortunes in the form of precious
stones, which, in enamelled settings of button-shape,
termed "boglars," were sewn on, or were mounted in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span>
aigrettes, or set in girdles or dagger-sheaths. Independent
jewels enriched with enamel-work in the Renaissance
taste were produced, too, in considerable quantity.
Fine examples of the latter are preserved in the
museum at Buda-Pesth; while to the exhibition held
there in 1884 Cinquecento jewellery of great beauty and
wealth was lent by noble Hungarian families. All
these display striking similarity to the jewels executed
at Augsburg, Prague, and elsewhere in the latter part
of the sixteenth and the early years of the seventeenth
century. In addition to those which betray the influence
of foreign styles, there are jewels of native
work, whose surface is enriched with the so-called
<i>Draht-Email</i>. This "filigree-enamel," which was executed
from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century
in Hungary and throughout the valley of the Danube,
is composed of bright opaque colours fired between
cloisons or partitions composed of twisted wire.</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</b><br />
<b>FRANCE&mdash;SPAIN</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE campaigns of Charles VIII and Louis XII
in Italy, and the patronage of Italian artists by
Cardinal d'Amboise, brought a knowledge of
Renaissance art into France. France was the first
nation to adopt the style of ornament to which Italy
had given birth, and at the very outset of the sixteenth
century Italian influence made itself felt. From the
reign of Francis I to that of Charles IX, French jewellery
was closely modelled on the Italian, while many Italian
jewellers took up their abode in France, and among
them Cellini, who resided in Paris from 1540 to 1545.</p>

<p>Not since the days of Charles V had France witnessed
such profusion of jewellery as was indulged in
by the splendour-loving Francis I who exceeded even
Henry VIII and Pope Paul III&mdash;two other great collectors
of the day&mdash;in gathering together jewels and
precious stones. We hear much of the jewellery of the
day from Rabelais, who speaks of the rosaries, girdle-ornaments,
rings, gold chains, jewelled necklaces and of
the various kinds of precious stones worn both in articles
of jewellery and scattered in profusion over the dress.</p>

<p>An incident of considerable interest is recorded to
have taken place in the time of Francis I in connection
with a supposed abuse of enamel on the part of the
jewellers. The king's attention was drawn to the fact
that when jewellery enamelled with opaque enamels,
which were considered to weigh heavier than the clear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span>
ones, came to be realised, the enamel was so much pure
loss. So, in spite of a protest by some of the leading
goldsmiths, who declared that the proper execution of
the majority of articles of jewellery was impossible
without opaque enamel, an ordinance was passed in
1540 forbidding its use. After three years, however,
the king relented, and again permitted the jewellers the
full exercise of the resources of their art, provided there
was no superfluous excess in the use of enamel.</p>

<p>Under the last Valois kings, Charles IX and Henry
III, the production of jewellery in France, as elsewhere,
was greater than at almost any other period. Vivid
descriptions of the rich jewellery of this time are furnished
by the chronicler Brant&ocirc;me.</p>

<p>Actual articles of French Renaissance jewellery are, it
must be confessed, of great rarity. Almost the only extant
specimens are the wonderful mounted cameos in the
Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at
Paris, the majority of which are presumably of French
origin. From comparison of these with contemporary
designs, the distinguishing features of the French
jewellery of the time appear to be&mdash;a cartouche-shaped
frame with comparatively unbroken outline, enriched
with scroll ornament and occasionally with human
figures and grotesques, a slight use of open-work, and
the general employment of a central ornament.</p>

<p>Like the Germans, the French had excellent masters,
who engraved models for jewellery of great beauty of
design. The following are the chief <i>ma&icirc;tres ornemanistes</i>
who flourished in the sixteenth century:&mdash;Jean
Duvet, known also as the Master of the Unicorn, born
at Langres in 1485 and died about 1562, was goldsmith
to Francis I and Henry II. His designs for small
objects of personal use in the form of scrolls, flowers,
and foliage, intended for execution in enamel, are
among the earliest engravings in <i>taille-douce</i> produced
for the purpose. Jacques Androuet Ducerceau (about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span>
1510-about 1585) worked chiefly at Orleans. His
numerous engravings in the form of cartouches with
rolled and voluted frames show the type of design
mainly employed for pendants. His actual models for
jewellery, numbering upwards of fifty, comprise clasps
and brooches, and many pendants, including earrings
(pp. 241 and 269).</p>

<p>After Androuet Ducerceau, the most famous jeweller
of this time was Etienne Delaune, called Stephanus
(1518-1595). He is said to have worked under Cellini
during the latter's residence in Paris. In 1573 he moved
to Strasburg, where the greater part of his work was
produced. A "little master" par excellence, he engraved
with extraordinary delicacy a number of exquisite
designs for jewellery. Two of his engravings of slightly
different design, both dated 1576, represent the interior
of goldsmiths' workshops, and are of particular interest
in illustrating the practice of the goldsmith's art and
the equipment of the workshop at this period.</p>

<p>Designs for jewellery are the most interesting of
the engravings of Ren&eacute; Boyvin (1530-1598), of Angers.
He appears to have been influenced by the Italian
artists of Fontainebleau, and his plates of jewel-ornament,
engraved with great skill in the style of Il
Rosso, show considerable ingenuity and fancy in the
combination of faceted stones and large pearls with
human and fantastic figures.</p>

<p>More influential perhaps than any of the designs
of the time are those of Pierre Woeiriot of Lorraine,
who was born in 1532 and died after 1589. In 1555
Woeiriot settled at Lyons, where he produced a large
number of engravings for jewellery. These, showing
the greatest variety of design, include numerous
patterns for rings, a dozen earrings, and ten pendent
ornaments (<a href="#PLATE_XXVII">Pl. XXVII, 3</a>). These masterpieces of engraving
and composition were published at Lyons in
1555 and 1561.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span>
Spain occupies a peculiar place with respect to its
Renaissance jewellery. In the sixteenth century the
Spanish Peninsula was perhaps the richest part of the
civilised world. Even at a time when universal luxury
in personal ornaments reigned, Spain made itself an
object of note by its extraordinary display in this
direction. The union under the same dominion of three
of the most powerful countries of Europe coincident
with the newly developed wealth of America resulted
in a desire among all classes for a more luxurious style
of living and for more sumptuous ornaments. The
natural instinct of wealthy and cultured individuals to
surround themselves with the choicest productions of
the fine arts led to the importation of the best of such
objects from other countries and of the first foreign
craftsmen of the day.</p>

<p>Juan de Arphe, "the Spanish Cellini," himself of
German extraction, devoted much attention to the
naturalisation of Renaissance forms. Other jewellers
also remained in so large a measure dependent on
foreign influence, at first of Italian types, and then of
the designs of French, German, and Flemish engravers
of ornament, that it is often hard to arrive at a decision
as to the precise provenance of their productions.
But just as other works of art, the product of different
countries, are stamped with certain indefinable characteristics,
which in general circumstances may at once
be detected, so jewels of Spanish origin betray the
influence of national temperament in their composition
and design. The series of drawings by Barcelona
jewellers published by Davillier in his <i>Recherches sur
l'Orf&egrave;vrerie en Espagne</i>, bear sufficient evidence of this
native spirit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the surviving examples
of the Renaissance jewellery of Spain approach
at times very near to those of Germany. And there
can be little doubt that the Nuremberg and Augsburg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span>
jewels which, as has been shown, were in vogue
not only all over Germany, but in France and England
and the Low Countries, were imported and imitated, as
Davillier says, by the goldsmiths of Spain.</p>

<p>The most important Spanish jewels of the sixteenth
century are in the form of enamelled pendants. Of
these the Victoria and Albert Museum possesses a
collection, excelled by that of no other public museum,
which acquired at the sale in 1870 of the treasures
of the sanctuary of the Virgen del Pilar at Saragossa.</p>

<p>A species of pendant which in Spain above all
places has always been popular was the reliquary. It
assumed numerous shapes; and among the many kinds
of adornment it received were small panels of painted
glass commonly known as <i>verres &eacute;glomis&eacute;s</i>.</p>

<p>This so-called <i>verre &eacute;glomis&eacute;</i>, which had been
handed down from antiquity and was used in the
Middle Ages, was brought to high perfection at the
Renaissance. Adopted from Italy, where it was also
employed for jewellery, it met with considerable favour
in Spain in the sixteenth century (<a href="#PLATE_XLIII">Pl. XLIII, 4</a>).</p>

<p>The process employed in its production consisted in
covering the under side of a plate of glass or rock
crystal with gold leaf. On this were traced the outlines
of the design intended to be reserved in gold, and the
remainder of the gold was then removed. In the painting
which followed, the finest details, the high lights,
the shadows and flesh tints were first executed. Then
came in successive applications, transparent varnishes
of different colours and thicknesses, in accordance with
the value of the tones desired. Small pieces of silver
leaf were applied to certain parts to reflect the light and
heighten the effect; and the whole was finally backed
with a sheet of
metal.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Verre &eacute;glomis&eacute; appears to take its name from one
Glomy, a French craftsman of the eighteenth century,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span>
who produced a special black and gold varnish which
he applied to the back of glass. In a similar way
his countrymen the Martins gave their name to the
varnish of their invention. Verre &eacute;glomis&eacute;, a somewhat
unsatisfactory title, which came first into use in
the latter part of the century, and was wrongly applied
to paintings under glass of a similar order, has been
retained ever since.</p>

<p>A peculiar and characteristic species of pendent
ornament, numbers of which were produced in the
seventeenth century chiefly at Barcelona, are certain
badges worn by members of religious corporations.
They are of open-worked gilt brass enriched with white,
black, and blue opaque enamels fused into recesses
stamped in the surface of the metal. These badges,
which are either triangular, oval, square, or oblong in
shape, are formed of two parts&mdash;a frame surrounded with
rayed patterns, and a central portion ornamented with
various designs (<a href="#PLATE_LIII">Pl. LIII, 5</a>). Among the latter designs
are crowned monograms of Christ or the Virgin, with
emblems such as palm leaves, and the device of a nail and
the letter S interlaced&mdash;a rebus for "Esclavo." Fitted in
the back is usually a miniature under crystal. In point
of technique these enamelled badges offer an interesting
comparison with the well-known English enamels of the
same date applied mainly to objects such as candlesticks
and fire-dogs. Pendent badges of the same designs
exist in gold. The collection of Se&ntilde;or de Osma at
Madrid contains several examples.</p>

<p>To the seventeenth century belong also the characteristic
"lazos" or bow-shaped jewels worn as breast-ornaments,
made of open-work gold set with emeralds,
and occasionally with other stones (<a href="#PLATE_LIII">Pl. LIII, 1</a>). Of the
same style are rings, also set with emeralds, and particularly
long earrings, which have always been popular in
Spain. The backs of these jewels are engraved with
floral designs. The greater part of the Spanish jewellery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span>
of the time is set with emeralds, which were acquired in
quantities from Peru. Spain has always had a great
reputation for these stones, which when of fine quality
are still alluded to as "old Spanish emeralds."
Emeralds are always subject to flaws and rarely free
from them. The emeralds set in Spanish jewellery,
though usually full of feathers, are nevertheless of
great decorative value. Further reference will be made
to Spanish work of the seventeenth century when the
jewels of that period are dealt with.</p>

<p>The earlier Hispano-Moresque jewellery is of considerable
rarity. It is often enriched with opaque
enamel fired between cloisons formed of twisted wire.
From the union of Moorish and Renaissance forms
developed the Spanish peasant jewellery, usually
fashioned of stout silver filigree parcel-gilt.</p>

<p class="center"><b>ENGLAND, SIXTEENTH CENTURY</b><br />
<b>(HENRY VIII&mdash;ELIZABETH&mdash;MARY STUART)</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>ITH the accession of Henry VIII a new
period opens in the history of the jeweller's
art. The spirit of the revival, which had
previously affected only the Court, began to spread
rapidly throughout the community, under the influence
of the example set by the great jewellers of Italy.
The King inherited an enormous treasury, and the display
of jewellery on his own person and on that of his
Court was prodigious. We are indebted to the Venetian
ambassador, Giustinian, for the following graphic
description of the King's personal adornment a year or
two after his accession&mdash;</p>

<p>"He wore a cap of crimson velvet, in the French
fashion, and the brim was looped up all round with
lacets and gold enamelled tags.... Very close round
his neck he had a gold collar, from which there hung a
rough-cut diamond, the size of the largest walnut I
ever saw, and to this was suspended a most beautiful
and very large round pearl. His mantle was of purple
velvet lined with white satin, the sleeves open, with a
train more than four Venetian yards long. This
mantle was girt in front like a gown, with a thick gold
cord, from which there hung large golden acorns like
those suspended from a cardinal's hat; over this mantle
was a very handsome gold collar, with a pendent St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span>
George entirely of diamonds. Beneath the mantle he
wore a pouch of cloth of gold, which covered a
dagger; and his fingers were one mass of jewelled
rings."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Many a lively and detailed picture has been left us
by the chronicler and lawyer, Edward Hall, of the
equipage and adornment of Henry VIII on his coronation
and at the court entertainments, and particularly
of the famous meeting of the Cloth of Gold, where, in
their insane desire to outshine each other, the English
and French nobles entered into boundless extravagance
in dress, and so loaded themselves with jewellery, that,
in the words of Du Bellay, "they carried the price of
woodland, water-mill, and pasture on their backs."
Many are the elaborate descriptions of entertainments
and pageants by the chroniclers Leland, Holinshed, and
Stowe, in which rich jewellery figures; but Hall's
Chronicle, the most minute in its accounts of contemporary
fashions, teems with references to "Gold Smithe's
woorke" and to the wealth of precious stones broidered
on the garments. The passion for personal ornaments
ran such riot that even foreign critics inveighed against
Englishmen for their extravagance.</p>

<p>This love of jewellery was largely due to foreign
fashions, which hitherto discountenanced, were growing
popular at Court, in consequence of the increasing
communication with the Continent. From the commencement
of Henry's reign merchants and craftsmen
from abroad swarmed in numbers into London, and
Hall, who shared the characteristic English antipathy
to all things foreign, gives an instance of an invasion
by these alien artificers. It was on the occasion of a
magnificent embassy from France in 1518 in connection
with the betrothal of the Princess Mary to the Dauphin
that there came, he says, "a great number of rascals
and pedlars and jewellers, and brought over divers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span>
merchantize uncustomed, all under the color of trussery
[baggage] of the ambassadors." In accordance with
the system of his predecessors in pursuit of their own
personal interests, Henry VIII extended his protection
to the foreigner, while the example of the French
Court, the rivalry with Francis I, and the foreign proclivities
of Wolsey and Cromwell induced him to
patronise extensively foreign jewellers and merchants
in precious stones. Occasionally Henry was a sufferer
in his transactions with sharp Italian dealers; and Cellini
relates a story of how a Milanese jeweller counterfeited
an emerald so cleverly that he managed to palm
off the same for a genuine stone on the sovereign of
"those beasts of Englishmen," as he elsewhere terms
them, for 9000 golden scudi. And all this happened,
because the purchaser&mdash;who was no less a
person than the King of England&mdash;put rather more
faith in the jeweller than he ought to have done. The
fraud was not found out till several years after.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the foreign craftsmen
patronised by the King were Italians; but in jewellery
the French influence seems to have predominated&mdash;judging
by the frequent mention of jewels of "Paris
work," and by the fact that the majority of the jewellers
mentioned in the "King's Book of Payments,"<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> bear
French names. Among those of foreign extraction
the following were the most prominent: Robert
Amadas, John Cryspyn, Allart Ploumyer, Jehan Lange,
Cornelius Hays, Baptist Leman, John Cavalcant,
John Baptista de Consolavera, Guillim Honyson,
Alexander of Brussels, John of Utrecht, and John
(Hans) of Antwerp. The mention, however, of such
names as John Angell, Morgan Fenwolf (a Welshman),
John Freeman, John Twiselton, Thomas Exmewe,
Nicolas Worley, John Monday, and William Davy
indicates the English nationality of several of the royal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span>
jewellers&mdash;though it is well to remember the common
tendency of the time to Anglicise foreign names.</p>

<p>Throughout the first half of his reign Henry placed
huge orders in the hands of these craftsmen, but advancing
years and an exhausted treasury appear to have
somewhat diminished his expenditure on personal ornaments.
Some interesting correspondence between the
above-mentioned Jehan Lange, a jeweller of Paris, and
certain of his native townsmen has been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> "The
King," he writes in 1537, referring to certain jewelled
garments he had submitted to His Majesty, "was very
glad to see such riches. He said he was too old to
wear such things, but he has offered 4000 cr." To
Allart Ploumyer he writes: "The King always makes
good cheer, but he has grown cold, and we have not
quite sold everything; for the gentlemen have spent
their money in the war." "I find the King," he says
in another place, "disinclined to buy, for he has told
me he has no more money, and it has cost him a great
deal to make war."</p>

<p>In spite of Lange's complaints, it was only just
before his death that Henry VIII acquired a famous
and magnificent historical jewel, the great pendant of
Charles the Bold, last Duke of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In its
centre was set the wonderful diamond&mdash;a deep pyramid
five-eighths of an inch square at the base&mdash;believed to
be the first on which Louis de Berghem tried his newly
invented method of cutting. Around it were set three
balas rubies, styled from their equality in size and
weight the "Three Brothers," which, owing to their fine
quality, were set open, without the foil with which
stones were then usually backed. Between these were
four enormous pearls (<a href="#PLATE_XXV">Pl. XXV, 3</a>). According to the
universal custom of his day, the Duke, accompanied by
all his treasure when campaigning, carried this jewel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span>
with him, partly to have it constantly under his personal
supervision, and partly because of the magic
properties then attributed to precious stones. Captured
by a common soldier from his tent after his memorable
defeat at the battle of Granson in 1475, the pendant
came into the possession of the magistrates of Berne,
and from them was purchased by Jacob Fugger, of the
opulent merchant family of Augsburg, whose son,
after keeping it for several years, disposed of it to
Henry VIII. Fifty years later the jewel was still
intact, and in James I's inventory of the crown jewels
in 1603, it is thus described:<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> "A fayre Flower,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> with
three greate ballaces, in the myddest a greate pointed
dyamonde, and three greate perles fixed, with a fayre
greate perle pendaunte, called <i>the Brethren</i>." The
last we hear of this famous jewel is in 1623, when it is
described in the same words in the list of jewels removed
from the Tower by James I, and handed over to
his jeweller Heriot to be refashioned for the use of
Charles and Buckingham on their visit to Spain.
That it was then remounted is evident from the King's
letter to his son, in which he says: "I send for your
wearing the Three Brethren, that you knowe full well,
but newlie sette."</p>

<p>About the year 1536 the great painter Hans Holbein,
who had come to England several years previously,
entered into the service of Henry VIII, and it was
between that date and his death in 1543 that he executed
those masterpieces of design for jewellery which will ever
stand as a landmark in the history of the subject. There
is no evidence to show that Holbein himself worked in
the precious metals. But brought up under similar
influences as had moulded the great Italian artists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span>
of the Renaissance, Ghiberti, Pollaiuolo, Verrocchio,
Francia, and Ghirlandaio, who combined the arts of
painting, architecture, and sculpture with the jeweller's
craft, he had been well grounded in the limitations of
his materials, and knew how far the draughtsman could
display his skill in this direction.</p>

<p>The most important of Holbein's designs for jewellery
are preserved in the British Museum, to which they
were bequeathed by Sir Hans Sloane in 1753. The
collection, originally mounted in a quarto volume,
termed Holbein's London Sketch-book, is now remounted
and systematically arranged. The designs,
comprising 179 separate items, are for the most part
drawn with a pen with black ink, and then some slight
touches of brown put in for the shadows. Several of
the designs have the ground blackened, the ornaments
being left in white. Some of the jewels, entirely
coloured and often touched up with gold, are designed
for enamelling in high relief; some are perhaps designed
for execution in niello, though it is not improbable
that these were intended to be ornamented
with black champlev&eacute; enamel. The most attractive are
the patterns for jewels enriched with precious stones and
enamels, the majority of which were for neck pendants
intended to hang from a chain, ribbon, or silken cord,
itself sometimes shown in the drawing (<a href="#PLATE_XXVI">Pl. XXVI</a>).</p>

<p>The design of a few of these pendants is based
upon the prevailing custom of wearing initials of the
name either in embroidery or in pure gold attached to
the garments. Some curious instances of this fashion
are recorded by Hall, particularly in his graphic account
of what took place at a masque given by Henry VIII at
his palace at Westminster. Upon the King's invitation
to divide the rich garments of the maskers sewn with
letters of "fine and massy gold in bullyon as thicke as
they might be," which generally went as largess to the
ladies, a rabble of citizens, who were allowed to look on,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span>
broke in, and "ranne to the Kyng and stripped hym
into his hosen and dublet, and all his compaignions in
like wyse. Syr Thomas Knevet stode on a stage, and
for all his defence he lost his apparell. The ladies like
wyse were spoyled, wherfore the Kynges garde came
sodenly, and put the people backe, or els it was
supposed more inconvenience had ensued." So pure
was the gold of which these letters were composed that
it is recorded subsequently that a "shipeman of
London who caught certayn letters sould them to a
goldsmyth for &pound;3. 14. 8"&mdash;quite a considerable sum in
those days.</p>

<p>In the same way jewelled initials were also frequently
worn in the form of pendants and a jewelled
B can be seen hanging from the neck of Anne Boleyn in
her portrait in the National Portrait Gallery. Holbein's
drawings contain several beautiful instances of this type
of design, generally completed with three pendent pearls.
One of them has a monogram of the initials R and E in
chased and engraved gold set at the four corners with
two rubies, an emerald, and a diamond. Another has
the letters H and I (probably for Henry and Jane
Seymour) with an emerald in the centre; and a somewhat
similar jewel, formed of the sacred monogram, is
worn by Jane Seymour in her portrait by Holbein at
Vienna.</p>

<p>The designs for the larger pendants, mostly circular
or lozenge-shaped, are set with sapphires, diamonds,
rubies, and pearls, and terminate with large pear-shaped
pearls. The spaces between the stones are filled with
chased or enamelled arrangements of scroll or leaf work.</p>

<p>The smaller jewels, which might also have been worn
as enseignes or badges on the hat, or as brooches, are of
open goldwork with leaf or ribbon ornament set with
stones and pearls. They include a very beautiful design
of a half-length figure of a lady in the costume of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span>
period holding between her hands a large stone, upon
which is the inscription <span class="smcap">well laydi well</span>
(<a href="#PLATE_XXVI">Pl. XXVI, 9</a>).
The fifteenth-century traditions seem to have influenced
Holbein in the design of this jewel, which at once calls
to mind the Flemish-Burgundian brooches (an example
of which, in the British Museum, has already been
mentioned) ornamented with similar figures, full-faced,
and holding a large stone before them.</p>

<p>The jewels actually executed from these designs
were probably the work of Hans of Antwerp, known
as John Anwarpe.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> He was a friend of Holbein, and
one of the witnesses of his will; and his portrait,
painted by Holbein, is now at Windsor. Hans of
Antwerp appears to have settled in London about
1514, having perhaps been induced to do so by Thomas
Cromwell, who in early life resided for a time in Antwerp
as secretary to the English merchants there. It
was presumably Cromwell who, as "Master of the King's
Jewel House," was instrumental in procuring for him
the post of the King's goldsmith. His name occurs
several times in Cromwell's accounts, and it was in
accordance with the latter's "ryght hartye commendations"
that he obtained the freedom of the Goldsmiths'
Company of London. The chief duty of the
King's goldsmith was to supply the New Year's gifts
(<i>estrennes</i>), so popular at that time. These usually
took the form of personal ornaments, and it seems
likely that Holbein's famous sketches were specially
designed for this purpose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>ELIZABETH&mdash;MARY STUART</b></p>

<p>However remarkable the Court of Henry VIII was
for its profusion of jewellery, that of Queen Elizabeth,
who inherited the Tudor love for display, was still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span>
more extravagant. Throughout her reign&mdash;a period
marked also upon the Continent for its prolific production
of jewellery&mdash;the fashion set by the jewel-loving
Queen for a superabundance of finery maintained its
sway. The country suddenly becoming wealthy, was
tempted, like one not born to riches, to use the whole
in outward show, and this display was rendered comparatively
easy by the influx of gold and precious stones
after the Spanish conquests in America.</p>

<p>Numerous portraits of courtiers and court ladies
afford ample evidence of the prevailing fashions in
jewellery, while the portraits of the Queen herself, all
overburdened with ornaments, are too well known to
need detailed description.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> "There is not a single portrait
of her," says Walpole, "that one can call beautiful.
The profusion of ornaments with which they are loaded
are marks of her continual fondness for dress, while
they entirely exclude all grace, and leave no more room
for a painter's genius than if he had been employed to
copy an Indian idol, totally composed of hands and
necklaces. A pale Roman nose, a head of hair loaded
with crowns and powdered with diamonds, a vast ruff,
a vaster fardingale, a bushel of pearls, are features by
which every body knows at once the pictures of Queen
Elizabeth."</p>

<p>An excellent description of the jewellery of Elizabeth
towards the close of her brilliant reign is given by
Paul Hentzner, who visited England in 1598: "The
Queen had in her ears two pearls with very rich
drops; she wore false hair and that red; upon her
head she had a small crown; her bosom was uncovered,
and she had on a necklace of exceedingly fine jewels.
She was dressed in white silk, bordered with pearls of
the size of beans, and over it a mantle of black silk
shot with silver threads; her train was very long.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span>
Instead of a chain, she had an oblong collar of gold
and jewels." To a courtier who knelt to her, "after
pulling off her glove, she gave her right hand to kiss,
sparkling with rings and jewels."</p>

<p>The best of all representations of that "bright occidental
Star" is her faded waxwork effigy, still to be seen
in Westminster Abbey&mdash;no other than the one which
on the 28th of April, 1603, was carried on her coffin to
the Abbey. It shows the veritable passion Elizabeth
possessed for pearls. Her stomacher is encrusted with
large Roman pearls, while strings of pearls hang round
her throat and neck. Her earrings are circular pearl and
ruby medallions, with huge pear-shaped pearl pendants.</p>

<p>Full of detail are the records of costly "juelles"
that have come down to us, particularly in the list,
preserved in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> of the New Year's
gifts presented to the Queen, from the fourteenth to
the thirty-sixth year of her reign. The practice of
exchanging presents on New Year's Day attained
extraordinary proportions at the Court of Elizabeth,
and was supplemented by birthday presents, which, as
Her Majesty's weakness for jewellery was well known,
took for the most part the form of personal ornaments
of every kind. The very accurate accounts that were
kept by the officers of the Queen's wardrobe of every
item in her enormous store of jewellery is witnessed by
a number of curious entries in her wardrobe-book of
losses of jewellery sustained by Her Majesty.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>In addition to numerous inventories and wills full
of information concerning the jewellery of the period,
we have at our service, as in Roman times, the works of
social satirists, such as <i>The Anatomie of Abuses</i>, by
Philip Stubbes (1583), and Bishop Hall's poetical satires
of 1597, to which we are indebted for many valuable
details. In accepting these it is well to bear in mind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span>
the common tendency of every age to ridicule its own
fashions; yet, in spite of Puritan narrowness, and the
exaggerated indignation of the satirist, it is manifest
that extraordinary luxury and extravagance in dress
and jewellery were prevalent not only at Court, but
among all classes of the community.</p>

<p>Of greater importance, however, than the information
to be gleaned from pictorial and literary sources is
that derived from the actual jewels themselves, a considerable
number of which, through all the changes and
chances of more than three centuries, have been handed
down still practically intact, and retaining the chief
feature of their decoration&mdash;their exquisite enamel.
Shakespeare, while appreciating the charm of its harmonious
combination of colours, recognised, it appears,
the delicacy of this beautiful medium, when in the
<i>Comedy of Errors</i> he makes Adriana say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
I see the jewel best enamelled<br />
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,<br />
That others touch, and often touching will<br />
Wear gold.</div></div></div>

<p>The New Learning, which made itself felt in England
during the reign of Henry VII, began at this time to
exercise a direct influence on the choice of the designs
of jewels and on the arrangement of their ornamentation.
As witnesses of the intellectual revival, they often
took emblematic forms, bearing in exquisite enamel-work
fancy mottoes and devices, generally obscure in
their interpretation, and intended to express the sentiments
of their wearers, or those of donors, regarding
the presumed state of mind of their recipients.</p>

<p>The passion for these reached its height in the
golden days of Good Queen Bess, when it became the
fashion for the bejewelled gallants who fluttered like a
swarm of glittering insects around her to display their
wit and ingenuity in devising jewelled emblems as fit
presents to the Virgin Queen. Thus in the list of costly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span>
articles of jewellery offered to Elizabeth, we meet with
the present, made in Christmas week 1581, by some
courtiers disguised as maskers, of a jewel in the form
of "a flower of golde, garnished with sparcks of
diamonds, rubyes, and ophales, with an agathe of her
Majestis phisnamy and a perle pendante, with devices
painted in it." The love for strange devices and
enigmatical mottoes was fostered by the spirit of an
age that witnessed the production of Lyly's <i>Euphues</i>
and Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>; while Elizabeth's colossal
vanity prompted the dedication to her of highly laudatory
mottoes, like the inscription on a jewel belonging
to Mr. Pierpont Morgan: <span class="smcap">hei mihi quod tanto
virtus perfusa decore non habet eternos inviolata
dies.</span> Few of the jewels of this stirring period
display a more charming symbolism than those produced
after the defeat and destruction of the Spanish
Armada, whereon England is figured as an ark floating
securely and tranquilly on a troubled sea, surrounded
by the motto, <span class="smcap">saevas tranquilla per undas.</span> The
most remarkable of these Armada jewels is Mr. Pierpont
Morgan's, just mentioned, and another of the same
class in the Poldi-Pezzoli Museum, Milan.</p>

<p>A jewel more characteristic of the period than
any other, and an historical relic of singular interest, is
that <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> of inventive genius&mdash;the Lennox or
Darnley jewel, the property of His Majesty the King.
It is covered inside and out with the most elaborate
symbolism, and contains altogether no less than twenty-eight
emblems and six mottoes (Pl. XXVIII, 4). Internal
evidence proves this remarkable jewel to have
been made by order of Lady Margaret Douglas, mother
of Henry Darnley, in memory of her husband, Matthew
Stuart, Earl of Lennox, who was killed in 1571.</p>

<p>Among many other examples of Elizabethan jewellery,
there stand out above the rest a certain number to
which, besides their high artistic excellence, is attached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span>
the additional interest of historical associations. To
this class belong the following important jewels: the
Berkeley heirlooms, belonging to Lord Fitzhardinge;
the Drake jewels, the property of Sir Francis Fuller-Eliott-Drake;
the Wild Jewel (Miss Wild); the Barbor
Jewel (Victoria and Albert Museum); and the Ph&oelig;nix
Jewel (Sloane Collection, British Museum). Public
and private collections likewise contain a considerable
number of enamelled miniature cases furnished with
loops for suspension, and cameos set with jewelled and
enamelled mountings of the period.</p>

<p>The Berkeley heirlooms, among which is the
Anglo-Saxon ring already mentioned, include the
Hunsdon Onyx, the Drake pendant in form of a ship,
Edward VI's Prayer Book, and a crystal armlet. These
exquisite jewels, according to tradition, were presented
by Queen Elizabeth to her cousin Henry Carey, Lord
Hunsdon, who died in 1596. They then passed to his
son George, the second Baron Hunsdon, who so highly
valued them, that he bequeathed them on his death, in
1603, to his wife, and afterwards to his only daughter
Elizabeth, with strict injunctions to transmit the same
to her posterity, to be preserved (according to the actual
terms of his will) "Soe longe as the conscience of my
heires shall have grace and honestie to perform my will,
for that I esteeme them right jeweles, and monumentes
worthie to be kept for theire beautie, rareness, and that
for monie they are not to be matched, nor the like yet
knowen to be founde in this realme." The jewels mentioned,
which came into the Berkeley family through
the marriage of the above-named Elizabeth Carey with
Lord Berkeley, are still preserved at Berkeley Castle.</p>

</div>

<p>Further reference to these and other remarkable Elizabethan
jewels will be given when the special species of
ornaments to which they belong is being dealt with.
There is one jewel of this date, however, which, though
it no longer exists, is of particular interest from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span>
fact that it is specially mentioned in the famous inventory
of Charles I's collection drawn up by Abraham
Van der Doort in 1639.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> This golden jewel, we learn,
was round, and hung with a small pendent pearl; one
side was enamelled with a representation of the battle
of Bosworth Field, and the other with the red and
white roses of Lancaster and York upon a green ground.
Within were four miniatures, Henry VII, Henry VIII,
Edward VI, and Queen Mary. The miniatures are
still preserved at Windsor Castle, but shorn of their
enamelled case, which has long since disappeared. The
jewel was bought by the King, so Van der Doort tells
us, from "young Hilliard," son of the famous miniaturist
Nicholas Hilliard, who, besides painting the
miniatures, probably also executed the enamel-work
upon the jewel itself. Hilliard, like the artists of the
Renaissance already cited, had been brought up as a
goldsmith and jeweller, and, as we see by the inscription
which he placed round his own portrait, held an
appointment as goldsmith at Elizabeth's Court; while
his knowledge and love of jewellery are admirably displayed
in his miniatures, in which every jewel is painted
with faultless accuracy and care.</p>

<p>The mention of Hilliard introduces to our notice
the other creators of the beautiful jewellery of the
period. English work continued to be influenced by
the Continent; and engraved designs for jewellery by
the Frenchmen Ducerceau and Woeiriot, and by the
eminent goldsmith and engraver Theodor de Bry, who
himself worked in London in 1587 and the two following
years, must have been well known and imitated in
England. In spite of this, however, it would appear
that Englishmen were no longer actually dependent for
their jewellery upon foreigners. The latter ceased to
hold the virtual monopoly they had once enjoyed; and
their place was taken by a number of native craftsmen.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span>
Among these, the following were the most prominent:
Dericke Anthony, Affabel Partridge, Peter
Trender, and Nicolas Herrick&mdash;elder brother of
William Herrick, James I's jeweller, and father of
Robert Herrick the poet. During the latter years of
her reign Hugh Kayle and his partner Sir Richard
Martin supplied the Queen with jewels as New Year's
gifts and presents to ambassadors amounting to upwards
of &pound;12,000.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to demonstrate that the
reign of Elizabeth, fertile in great events, was productive
of much important jewellery, whose charm, excellence,
and historic interest have, up to the present, by
no means received the attention they deserve. And it
may be stated, without prejudice, that jewels of the
period which bear a clear stamp of English origin
compare favourably, nay even advantageously, with the
productions of contemporary jewellers of the Continent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The jewels of the unhappy Mary Stuart form a
subject of peculiar interest. Like her jealous rival
Queen Elizabeth, Mary was most lavish in her display
of jewellery. In addition to the crown jewels she had a
profusion of personal ornaments, her own private
property. Her inventories, published by the Bannatyne
Club (1863), furnish many a vivid description of the
splendid objects which, during the course of her turbulent
life, she bestowed on her friends or lost under
stress of circumstances. They have further acquired
quite an historical celebrity "from the frequency with
which they were claimed by their unfortunate mistress
in her appeals for mercy and justice during her long
captivity, and the rapacity with which her royal jailer
and other enemies sought or retained possession of
these glittering spoils."</p>

<p>It is impossible here to enter into details respecting
the many beautiful things recorded in her inventories,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span>
or the strange vicissitudes that they underwent. Their
dispersal would seem to have begun with her infatuated
passion for Bothwell. The number of jewels she
lavished on him when they parted on Carberry Hill,
those she distributed as personal gifts, and others that
served in the various emergencies in which the unfortunate
Queen found herself, afford some idea of the extraordinary
quantity of precious articles in her possession.
A few of Mary's actual jewels, such as the Duke
of Norfolk's rosary and jewelled necklace, the Duke
of Portland's jewelled cameo, and the Penicuik jewel,
have been preserved to our own day. Along with the
historical documents must rank the Leven and Melville
portrait&mdash;the brilliant centre-piece of Mr. Andrew
Lang's <i>Portraits and Jewels of Mary Stuart</i>. As far
as jewellery in general is concerned, this portrait may be
said to merit greater consideration than any picture of
its own or of other times, in that it displays a complete
parure of contemporary jewellery, each item of which is
entered and described in detail in the personal inventories
of the individual it represents.</p>

<p class="center"><b>RENAISSANCE HEAD-ORNAMENTS</b><br />
<b>(ENSEIGNES, AIGRETTES, HAIR-PINS, EARRINGS)</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE origin of the ornaments for the hat or cap,
known generally as enseignes, has been mentioned
in dealing with the jewellery of the
Middle Ages. At the period of the Renaissance, the
enseigne&mdash;the "bijou par excellence" it has been termed&mdash;was
above all the recipient of the very highest workmanship,
and formed the subject of varied designs of
the most ingenious character. By the beginning of the
fifteenth century fashion had already turned hat-badges
almost entirely into articles of adornment, and judging
by that worn by King Dagobert in Petrus Christus's
picture of 1449, and, amongst many other portraits, by
that of Richard III in the National Portrait Gallery,
these jewels were composed of goldsmith's work,
enamelled, and set with precious stones. In the sixteenth
century the majority of enseignes seem always to have
borne some figured design; and Cellini, referring to the
year 1525, says: "It was the custom at that epoch to
wear little golden medals, upon which every nobleman
or man of quality had some device or fancy of his own
engraved; and these were worn in the cap."</p>

<p>For a considerable time the earlier religious badges
sold at places of pilgrimage continued to be worn.
Though enseignes very frequently bore some religious
representation, or the figure or emblem of some patron
saint, they ended, like other articles primarily religious,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span>
by becoming purely secular, and took the forms of
devices of a fanciful or even humorous character.</p>

<p>Every one from the highest rank downwards had
his personal <i>devise</i> or <i>impresa</i>, or more often a series of
them. It was worn as an emblem&mdash;an ingenious expression
of some conceit of the wearer, the outcome of
his peculiar frame of mind. It usually contained some
obscure meaning, the sense of which, half hidden and
half revealed, was intended to afford some play for the
ingenuity of the observer. The love of the time for
expressing things by riddles led to the publication of
sets of emblems, like those of Alciatus, which had
imitators in all directions. Every one, in fact, tried his
hand at these "toys of the imagination."</p>

<p>Numbers of enseignes are mentioned in the inventories,
and male portraits very commonly exhibit
this form of decoration. Women also wore them upon
the hat or in the hair, but not until about the middle of
the sixteenth century. The hat was turned up so as to
show the lining, and the badge was usually placed under
the rim, at the side, and somewhat to the front of the
hat. Some of these medallions are furnished with a
pin, like a brooch; but as the majority have loops at the
edge, or are pierced with holes for the purpose of sewing
them to the head-dress, they can as a rule be distinguished
from ordinary brooches. Pendants of the
same form as those hung from neck-chains also appear
occasionally as enseignes upon the hat.</p>

<p>In England, during the sixteenth century, brooches,
owches, or nowches, as they were often called, were
extensively worn in caps and hats<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> as men's jewels in
particular; and besides these there were jewelled hat-bands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span>
richly decorated with precious stones. The
chronicler Hall mentions that on one occasion, in 1513,
Henry VIII wore a hat called a "chapeau montabyn"
which was adorned with a rich band or coronal, and had
in addition an enseigne, for "y<sup>e</sup> folde of the chapeau
was lined with crimsyn saten; and on y<sup>t</sup> a riche brooch
withe y<sup>e</sup> image of sainct George." An enamelled
brooch of this design modelled in full relief with the
figure of St. George and the dragon, with the Princess
Sabra in the background, is preserved amongst
the exceedingly interesting series of jewels in His
Majesty's collection at Windsor Castle. It is of gold,
finely chased, brilliantly modelled, and surrounded with
an open wire balustrade enamelled green. This brooch,
traditionally believed to have been worn by Henry VIII,
is known as the Holbein George; but internal evidences
tend to prove the unlikelihood of Holbein having had
any hand in its construction. It appears to be of
Venetian origin&mdash;though not without some traces of
German influence&mdash;and to date from the first few
years of the sixteenth century (<a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Pl. XXVIII, 2</a>).</p>

<p>There exist several other jewels, the majority of
them hat-ornaments, executed in this so-called "gold
wire" enamel,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> of the same exquisite and rare style of
workmanship, and all possessing a singular likeness to
that at Windsor, both in the patterns of the dresses
worn by the figures represented on them, and in
general treatment, particularly of the hair of the
figures, which is formed of ringlets of spiral twisted
gold wire. Among other examples are two in the
Salting Collection, another which was lately in the
collection of Sir T. Gibson Carmichael,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and a fourth
in the Cabinet des Antiques in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale, Paris.</p>

<p>The wide range of subjects chosen for hat-ornaments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span>
can best be judged from the lists of "bonnets" in
Henry VIII's possession in the years 1526 and 1530,
enriched with a variety of brooches.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Representations of enseignes in pictures are too
frequent to permit of any attempt to enumerate
them. It is impossible, however, to refrain from
drawing attention to the fine male portraits of Bartolommeo
Veneto, an artist of marked individuality
of character, who worked at Venice from about 1505 to
1530. He appears to have delighted in painting with
peculiar care the beautiful enseignes worn by his sitters&mdash;attractive
jewels enamelled in <i>ronde bosse</i>, and contemporary
with the Windsor "George" and its fellows.
The examples of his work that display such ornaments
in the most striking manner are in the following collections:
Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; Dorchester
House, London; the Crespi Gallery, Milan; the collection
of Baron Tucher at Vienna; and the National
Gallery, Rome.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>One of the most exquisite jewels of the Renaissance
is a medallion of enamelled gold numbered 5583
in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris. It is oval, and
in a space of 2 by 2<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub></span> inches contains a composition of
no less than twelve men and eight horses in high relief,
representing a battle. Horsemen and foot-soldiers in
antique armour are engaged in furious combat, and many
have fallen. One horseman carries a banneret which
flies in the wind. The background is enamelled green,
and the figures, delicately modelled, are white, save for
their armour and weapons, which are reserved in the
gold. The frame of the jewel is furnished with four
loops, which clearly explain its use (<a href="#PLATE_XXIX">Pl. XXIX, 2</a>).
Its design offers an interesting comparison with two
cameos (Nos. 643 and 644), themselves fanciful renderings
of the subject of another cameo (No. 645), and an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span>intaglio, the work of Matteo del Nassaro, in the same
collection, both undoubtedly inspired by the famous
painting after Raphael, known as the Battle of Constantine
at the Milvian Bridge (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 312), in the so-called
Gallery of Constantine in the Vatican.</p>

<p>Among the jewels in the public collections in London,
which on account of their design or form were
presumably intended to be worn in the hat or cap,
there are several noteworthy examples. The Wallace
Collection contains a circular gold enseigne, repouss&eacute;,
chased, and partly enamelled, with a representation of
Judith carrying the head of Holofernes. It is probably
Italian. In the Waddesdon Bequest at the British
Museum is an oval badge enamelled in relief with the
Judgment of Paris. It is of the same minute style of
work as that of the "Battle-Piece," and is of striking
similarity to a drawing by Hans Mielich, in the Royal
Library, Munich.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>An enseigne in the Victoria and Albert Museum&mdash;perhaps
the most beautiful of all, and probably the
work of a Florentine goldsmith&mdash;represents the head
of John the Baptist on a charger. The <i>caput Johannis
in disco</i>, a favourite subject in medi&aelig;val art both in
painting and sculpture, was also popular for personal
ornaments. This symbol of the Precursor was no
doubt phylacteric, for the efficacy of his intercession
was most highly esteemed against epilepsy and other
disorders. The enseigne in question, contemporary
with one described as a "St. John's head in a dish" in
Henry VIII's possession in 1530, is of gold, one and
five-eighths of an inch in diameter, and shaped like a
circular dish. It has a corded edge, and round the
rim, in pierced and raised letters, now only partially
enamelled, are the following words: <span class="smcap">non &middot; surexsit &middot;
inter &middot; natos &middot; mulierum.</span> The sunk centre is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span>
covered with translucent ruby enamel, and in the
middle is the head of the saint in gold and white
enamel. The head is delicately modelled, and such care
has the artist displayed in its execution that he has
shown above the eyebrow the gash which Herodias,
according to the legend,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> on receiving the head from
Salome, inflicted on it with a pin from her hair, or with
a knife seized from the table where the feast had taken
place (<a href="#PLATE_XXIX">Pl. XXIX, 1</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">renaissance enseignes</span>
</div>

</div>

<p>All the four enseignes last mentioned are examples
of the method of executing these ornaments described
in Cellini's famous treatise<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> on the goldsmith's art,
where he extols the goldsmith Caradosso as a craftsman
skilled above all others in their production. The
work is repouss&eacute;; the St. John's head being also
worked into full relief by this process, and then applied
to the dish. Such repouss&eacute; figures were frequently
attached to an independent background formed of lapis-lazuli,
agate, or some other precious substance.</p>

<p>The revival of the art of gem-engraving led to a
large demand for cameos&mdash;themselves more suitable for
decorative purposes than intaglios&mdash;as personal ornaments.
"It was much the custom of that time," says
Vasari, writing of the gem-engraver Matteo del Nassaro,
"to wear cameos and other jewels of similar kind
round the neck and in the cap." Matteo produced
many admirable cameos for use as enseignes for
Francis I and the nobles of his Court, almost every
one of whom carried on their persons some example of
his work. On jewels of this kind parts of the figures
were occasionally executed in cameo, and the remainder
in gold, chased and enamelled; but more frequently
figures were worked entirely in hard material, and then,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span>
in accordance with the artistic taste of the time, enclosed
in borders, enriched with enamel and jewel-work
of the most exquisite variety of design. Unhappy
vicissitudes, like those which the gems at Florence
have undergone,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> have in course of time despoiled many
a cameo of its rich setting. Yet in the great public
gem collections of London, Paris, Vienna, St. Petersburg,
Berlin, Munich, and Dresden, as well as in the
cabinets of private collectors, are to be found a number
of beautiful examples of the jeweller's art at its best
period, which have been preserved on account of the
cameos they served to adorn.</p>

<p>The finest enseigne that displays cameo and enamelled
gold worked together in combination is Cellini's exquisite
"Leda and the Swan," in the M&uuml;nz-und-Antiken-Kabinet
at Vienna. The head and the torso of the figure of
Leda is in cameo&mdash;the latter being an antique fragment;
the remainder of the jewel is of gold, enriched with enamels,
diamonds, and rubies. This is considered to be
the actual jewel executed by Cellini at Rome about 1524
for the Gonfalonier Gabriele Cesarini<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> (Pl. XXIX, 5).</p>

<p>By far the most extensive collection of mounted
cameos is preserved in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at
Paris. The majority of these jewels which follow the
cartouche form are presumably of French fabrique,
though a decision as to their precise provenance is
here, as ever, a matter of considerable difficulty. Among
brooches or medallions for the hat, whose purpose is
clearly indicated by the presence of a pin or holes for
attachment, the most noticeable are four, numbered
respectively 595, 465, 513, and 1002. The first, bearing
the head of a negro in agate, encircled with a band of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_229" id="page_229">{229}</a></span>
rubies, has an outer border of open scrollwork, of white,
heightened with red enamel. On each side and below is
a table diamond; and above, a crown set with triangular
faceted diamonds (<a href="#PLATE_XXIX">Pl. XXIX, 4</a>). Lack of space precludes
detailed reference to the other three <i>enseignes de chaperon</i>.
They are equally attractive, both on account of their
design and the high quality of their workmanship.</p>

<p>Those unable to afford such costly ornaments
wore hat-brooches or medallions in cheaper materials,
either bronze or copper. These were cast or stamped,
and not, like the more magnificent enseignes of gold,
executed by the repouss&eacute; process. The work of the
earlier medallists was produced by means of casting,
the medallions being afterwards delicately chased.
From the beginning of the sixteenth century, medallists,
who, it may be remembered, were mostly jewellers
and gem-engravers as well, executed engraved dies,
from which their medallions were struck instead of
cast. The majority of smaller medallions so generally
worn as hat-badges were multiplied by the newer process
of stamping, and pierced with holes for attachment
to the head-dress. They were afterwards gilded and
occasionally enriched with enamel. Further information
about the cheaper class of enseignes is met with in
Bernard Palissy's <i>Art de la terre</i>, according to which
the enamellers of Limoges, owing to competition, had
to supply figured hat-badges at <i>trois sols la douzaine</i>.
"Which badges were so well worked and their enamels
so well melted over the copper that no picture could be
prettier." Brooches of even cheaper materials are
alluded to by Shakespeare in <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>,
when Biron and Dumain, ridiculing Holofernes, who
acts as Judas in the pageant of the Nine Worthies,
exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i>Biron.</i> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.</span><br />
<i>Dumain.</i> <span style="margin-left: .1em;">Ay, and in a brooch of lead.</span><br />
<i>Biron.</i> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.</span></div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span>
The fashion for enseignes lasted until about the
second quarter of the seventeenth century. During this
later period they were generally worn in the hats of persons
of wealth and distinction, in the form of a cluster of
precious stones<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
(<a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Pl. XXXIV, 3</a>); while the enseignes
with figured compositions appear to have fallen into
disuse. The remarkable letter addressed by James I to
Charles and Buckingham in Spain, in 1623, deals chiefly
with jewelled hat-brooches of this kind (<a href="#page_300">p. 300</a>).
Hat-bands richly jewelled were likewise worn; and among
the jewels sent to Spain for the use of the Prince was a
magnificent hat-band "garnished with 20 diamonds set
in buttons of gold in manner of Spanish work." It was
made up of the following stones, representing every mode
of cutting employed at the time: 8 four-square table
diamonds, 2 six-square table diamonds, 2 eight-square
table diamonds, 2 four-square table diamonds cut with
facets, 2 large pointed diamonds, 1 fair heart diamond,
and 3 triangle diamonds.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>AIGRETTES</b></p>

<p>At the end of the sixteenth and the beginning
of the seventeenth century an aigrette was often worn
in the hat, a jewelled brooch being employed to hold it.
The latter was sometimes in the form of a pipe or socket
into which the stems of the feathers were inserted. A
fine example of this class of ornament, discovered at
Lauingen in the coffin of Otto Henry, Count Palatine of
Neuburg (d. 1604), is now preserved with the rest of
the jewels of the same family in the Bavarian National
Museum at Munich. It is in the shape of a heart open-worked
and enriched with enamel, and has in the centre
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_231" id="page_231">{231}</a></span>
the letters D.M.&mdash;initials of his wife Dorothea Maria&mdash;set
with rubies. Behind is a tube for the reception
of an aigrette of herons' feathers (<a href="#PLATE_XXX">Pl. XXX, 3</a>).</p>

<div class="box">

<span class="caption">jewelled hat-ornaments, (aigrettes, etc.)</span><br />
<span class="caption2">late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries</span></div>

</div>

<p>Though never in general use, feathers with settings
mounted with precious stones and attached by jewelled
brooches were worn long before this date; and Charles
the Bold's hat&mdash;<i>chapeau montauban</i>&mdash;(Lambecius, <i>Bib.
Caes. Vindobon.</i>, II, p. 516) was enriched with feathers
of this description magnificently jewelled.</p>

<p>About the commencement of the seventeenth century
the feather aigrette was often replaced by one of precious
stones. A jewel of this form is in the Waddesdon
Bequest. It is 3&frac12; inches in height, and formed of five
plumes&mdash;three jewelled with rubies and diamonds and
the others enamelled white&mdash;rising from an open-worked
ornament in the form of military trophies, enamelled
and set with four diamonds. A design for an aigrette
of almost exactly the same style may be seen among the
engravings for jewellery by the Augsburg goldsmith
Daniel Mignot. The engravings of Paul Birckenhultz
(<i>c.</i> 1617) likewise contain designs for similar ornaments.
These jewelled aigrettes were much in fashion in England
at the time of James I, and a "feather jewel"
or "jewel of gold in fashion of a feather, set with
diamonds," is mentioned several times in the royal
accounts. The finely executed drawings for jewellery
in the Victoria and Albert Museum by Arnold Lulls,
jeweller to James I, include four coloured designs for
jewelled aigrettes (Pl. XXX, 1). They are provided
with short, stout pins, and set with rubies, sapphires,
emeralds, and diamonds, arranged in the most tasteful
manner, and are evidently intended to be further enriched
with enamel. Other jewelled aigrettes in favour
in the seventeenth century were composed solely of
precious stones. Reference will be made to these in
a later chapter dealing with the ornaments of that
period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>HAIR-PINS</b></p>

<p>Besides the enseigne worn occasionally by ladies,
the jewelled aigrettes of more frequent use, and the
gold circlets set with precious stones, more elaborate
forms of head-decoration were employed. Though
these were often entwined with ropes of pearls and
sprinkled with precious stones, they belong rather to
costume proper. There remain, however, hair-pins, of
which we obtain a certain amount of information from
the inventories, and from the few actual specimens that
still remain.</p>

<p>Hair-pins, like other articles of Renaissance jewellery,
are remarkable for their variety of design, particularly
as far as the heads of the pins are concerned.
In the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg are several
hair-pins with heads variously ornamented, one of them
being in the form of a small enamelled hand. The
shaft of the pin is often flat, open-worked and enamelled;
occasionally the head is attached to it by a ring and
hangs loosely from it. A gold enamelled hair-pin is
among the jewels of Princess Amalia Hedwig (d. 1607),
the contents of whose coffin, opened in the eighteenth
century with those of the Counts Palatine of Neuburg
at Lauingen, are now in the Bavarian National Museum.
This pin has a small open rosette hanging loosely from
it set with five diamonds and five pendent pearls.
Contemporary portraits show how these pins were worn,
and in a portrait of a young woman by Peter Moreelse
in the Rotterdam Gallery, just such a pin is seen thrust
in under the close-fitting lace cap so that the pendent
head rests upon the forehead.</p>

<p>In the inventories of the time hair-pins are termed
<i>bodkins</i>; and among Queen Elizabeth's New Year's
gifts are several of these richly decorated bodkins.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span>
Thus: "A bodkyn of golde, garnished at the ende with
four smale diamondes and a smale rubye, with a crown
of ophales, and a very smale perle pendant peare
fashone." "A bodkin of golde, with a flower thearat,
garnished with smale rubyes and ophals on one side."
"A bodkinne of silver, with a little ostridg of gold, pendant,
enamuled, and two waspes of golde lose enamuled."
In the inventory of jewels of Anne, Duchess of Somerset,
second wife of the Protector Somerset (1587), is
"a bodkynne of golde, with clawes in the ende, inamyled
blacke."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>EARRINGS</b></p>

<p>The fashion of wearing the hair over the ears,
which, as we have seen, completely banished earrings
from among the ornaments of the Middle Ages, greatly
checked their use during the sixteenth century. In
Italian pictures one finds here and there some traces of
them, but compared with the profusion of other ornaments,
their almost complete absence is somewhat
surprising. The most remarkable instance
of their use is the beautiful portrait
of a lady by Sodoma, or by Parmigianino,
in the St&auml;del Institute at Frankfort, where
are seen elaborate earrings of open-work
scroll pattern with three pendent pearls.
They measure upwards of two and a half
inches in length. The so-called Fornarina
in the Tribuna of the Uffizi wears a small
gold pendant in the form of an amphora
attached to a simple ring; while in the
portrait by Angelo Bronzino in the Pitti
Gallery, supposed to be that of Bianca Cappello (1548-87),
wife of Francesco de' Medici, the lobe of the ear is
pierced twice, and the two rings placed in it support a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span>
pendant formed of two pearls mounted in gold, with
three hanging pearls below.</p>

<p><a name="img233" id="img233"></a></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/img233.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption1">Earring, from Portrait of a Lady by
Sodoma (Frankfort Gallery).</span>
</div>

<p>In the second half of the sixteenth century, with
the altered mode of wearing the hair, earrings, though
still rare in pictures, appear to have come more into
fashion, and the prints of Woeiriot, Collaert, Birckenhultz,
and other engravers of the day, as well as a
number of examples in the various museums, show the
types then in use.</p>

<p>English portraits of the first half of the sixteenth
century do not exhibit these ornaments, but when they
appear later on, as in the numerous portraits of Queen
Elizabeth, they are usually in the form of pear-shaped
pearl drops. Mary Queen of Scots appears to have
generally worn earrings, judging by the inventory of
her jewels in 1561,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> which contains a very large number,
including the following: "Deux pendans doreille faictz
en facon de croix de Hierusalem esmaillez de blanc&mdash;Deux
petis pendans doreille garniz de deux petittes
perles de facon de doubles ames&mdash;Deux petis pendans
doreille dor emplis de senteure."</p>

<p>The use of earrings, curiously enough, was not
confined to women, and we find men, even the sedatest,
wearing them. "Women," says Philip Stubbes in his
<i>Anatomie of Abuses</i> (1583), "are so far bewitched as
they are not ashamed to make holes in their ears,
whereat they hang rings, and other jewels of gold and
precious stones; but this," he adds, "is not so much
frequented among women as among men." This custom
appears to have originated in Spain, where the use of
earrings was pretty general among both sexes, and as
the result of Spanish influence was introduced into
France at the luxurious Court of Henry III. The
fashion subsequently came to England, where it was
generally affected by the courtiers of Elizabeth and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span>
James I, as is clear from contemporary male portraits,
where an earring is worn, as a rule, in one ear only.
Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, is seen in the National
Portrait Gallery wearing a ruby earring; while the
Duke of Buckingham was particularly noticeable for
the splendour of his diamond earrings. Commenting
on the degeneracy of his contemporaries, Holinshed in
his <i>Chronicle</i> (1577) observes: "Some lusty courtiers
also and gentlemen of courage do wear either rings of
gold, stones, or pearl in their ears, whereby they imagine
the workmanship of God to be not a little amended."
In a splendour-loving time one might expect to find such
ornaments among courtiers, but that earrings were
worn also by men of action and men of parts is
evident from the portraits of Shakespeare, Sir Walter
Raleigh, and the Earl of Southampton.</p>

<p>The use of earrings among men continued to the
time of Charles I, and in Lenton's <i>Young Gallant's
Whirligigg</i> (1629) a fop is described with&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;">
Haire's curl'd, eares pearl'd, with
Bristows<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
brave and bright, Bought for true Diamonds in his false sight.</p>

<p>King Charles himself followed the general fashion and
hung a large pearl in his left ear. This he wore even on
the scaffold, where he took it from his ear and gave it
to a faithful follower. It is still preserved, and is now
owned by the Duke of Portland. It is pear-shaped,
about five-eighths of an inch long, and mounted with a
gold top, and a hook to pass through the ear.</p>

<p>Earrings, together with similar luxuries, vanished
at the time of the Protectorate; men are not seen wearing
them after the Restoration, though they are still in
use among certain classes on account of their supposed
value as preservatives against affections of the eyes.</p>

<p class="center"><b>RENAISSANCE NECKLACES, NECK-CHAINS, AND COLLARS</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">N</span>ECKLACES or neck-chains worn by both
sexes are a prominent feature in Renaissance
jewellery. Just as in primitive times the neck
was encircled by a torque, so at this later period it was
the custom to carry heavy chains of pure gold, which
were worn in different ways, either round the throat, or
else upon the shoulders and low down over the breast.
Sometimes one long chain was wound several times
round the neck so that the uppermost row closely
encircled the throat. Not satisfied with one, women in
particular occasionally wore as many as half a dozen
chains of different design covering the body from neck
to waist.</p>

<p>From the fifteenth until the middle of the seventeenth
century neck-chains were a frequent adjunct to
male costume, and allusion is made to them in
Barclay's <i>Ship of Fools</i> (printed by Pynson in
1508):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Some theyr neckes charged with colers, and chaynes<br />
As golden withtthes: theyr fyngers ful of rynges:<br />
Theyr neckes naked: almoste vnto the raynes;<br />
Theyr sleues blasinge lyke to a Cranys wynges.</div></div></div>

<p>Men's necklaces, apart from the chains and collars
of distinction belonging to particular orders or guilds,
seem to have been mostly of pure gold, and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span>
reign of Henry VIII the fashion of wearing them was
carried to a most unreasonable excess. Hall speaks of
the "nombre of chaynes of golde and bauderickes both
massy and grate" worn at the Field of the Cloth of
Gold, and of the "marveilous treasor of golde" thus
displayed. References to the extraordinary dimensions
of these chains show that they must have been extremely
inconvenient to wear. Henry VIII's Book of
Payments records the payment in 1511 of &pound;199 to the
goldsmith Roy for a chain of gold weighing no less than
98 ounces. This is actually surpassed in Elizabeth's time,
when Her Majesty received as a New Year's gift in 1588
"one cheine of golde, weing one hundred threescore
and one ounce." Queen Mary had a heavy chain of
gold made by her jeweller, Robert Raynes, out of the
angels received as New Year's gifts;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and the curious
custom of converting bullion into chains is further
exemplified in the case of Sir Thomas Gresham, the
bulk of whose wealth on his death in 1579 was found
to consist of gold chains.</p>

<p>Pictures without number exhibit these ponderous
neck-ornaments, while contemporary wills teem with
references to them. That they were very much worn in
Shakespeare's time would be apparent had we no other
authority than his frequent allusion to them, as for
instance in the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, where there is a
great ado about a chain. Indeed, no gentleman was
considered properly equipped unless he had his chain
of gold upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>With regard to their form, it seems that chains
which appear as though made of plaited wire, and were
known in medi&aelig;val times, remained still in use. But
the majority of chains are composed of rounded links
of various designs. They are usually of great length,
so as to encircle the neck and shoulders several times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span>
Extraordinarily common though such chains must
have been, but few examples have survived, and the
reason for this must be that, composed of pure metal,
they went direct to the melting-pot as soon as they
became unfashionable. Yet owing to peculiar circumstances
some still exist. In the Germanic Museum at
Nuremberg are preserved several examples dating from
the first quarter of the seventeenth century. These
formerly belonged to the Holtzendorff family, and were
buried during the Thirty Years' War, at Pinnow in
North Germany, where they were unearthed a few years
ago.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Two gold chains dating from about the middle
of the same century are preserved in the Ashmolean
Museum. They were presented to Elias Ashmole: the
one 29 inches long, formed of thirty-two open-work
quatrefoil links, by Christian V, King of Denmark,
and the other, of circular links, by the Elector of
Brandenburg in 1680, on the publication of the <i>History
of the Order of the Garter</i>. The custom of presenting
chains of gold was as common then, it is to be
observed, as in the most ancient times. John Williams,
jeweller of James I, was paid sums amounting to upwards
of &pound;13,000 for chains of gold given by the King
to divers ambassadors.</p>

<p>These heavy linked or twisted chains were worn
principally by men, but not exclusively, as is clear from
numerous early portraits&mdash;those, for instance, by the
German painters Bernard Strigel and Lucas Cranach,
whose ladies (as in the portrait by Cranach in the
National Gallery) almost invariably have massive gold
chains. Though generally composed of metal rings,
men's chains, especially those worn by men of high
rank, were occasionally composed of cylinders or
plaques linked together and enriched with enamel and
precious stones. Such jewelled collars were, however,
chiefly reserved for women. Henry VIII's numerous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span>
portraits generally show him adorned with magnificent
collars set with pearls and precious stones; and it is
recorded that on the occasion of his attending St. Paul's
at the proclamation of peace in 1515 he wore a collar
thickly studded with the finest carbuncles, as large as
walnuts. Amongst the numerous collars mentioned in
his inventory of 1526 is a "carkayne of hearts, with a
hand at each end, holding a device of a goodly balasse
garnished with five pearls and three diamonds, and a
hanging pearl."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The jewelled neck-chain worn by women, and composed
of strings of precious stones, "ropes of pearls",
or of jewelled and enamelled sections, is often represented
in pictures as being gathered in a festoon at the
breast and hanging in loops at each side as low as the
waist. A chain of gold of this character&mdash;one amongst
many similar presented by the Earl of Leicester to
Queen Elizabeth&mdash;was "made like a pair of beads,
containing eight long pieces, garnished with small
diamonds, and four score and one smaller pieces, fully
garnished with like diamonds."</p>

<p>Besides the chains or collars worn round the neck
and upon the shoulders, there were the actual necklets
worn round the throat, and often only distinguishable
from the collar proper by their length (Pl. XXXI, 1).
These necklaces, or carcanets, which almost invariably
had as a central ornament an elaborate pendent jewel, are
figured in such profusion in sixteenth-century portraits,
particularly by the painters of the German school, that
it is needless to mention particular examples. In Henry
VIII's time they were worn in great abundance. The
King loaded his wives with sumptuous jewels, and encircled
their throats&mdash;on which the axe was eventually to
fall&mdash;with jewelled and enamelled necklaces. The "carkyonetts"
of Queen Elizabeth, of which she received an immense
number, were equally magnificent. A New Year's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span>
gift in 1587 was a "carkyonett of golde, like halfe moones,
garnished with sparcks of rubyes and diamonds pendant,
and one rowe of seede perles."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The forms of the necklaces and jewelled neck-chains
differ so much that the reader must be referred to the
various collections of this country and the Continent.
Occasionally necklaces of chain formation or of plaited
wire are set with stones, but of more frequent occurrence
are those where every single link shows a special
development of a bijou kind. In the Renaissance
necklace every link is for the most part treated as a
symmetrical composition, either cartouche-shaped or of
pendent form. Hence it happens that in collections, as
Herr Luthmer suggests,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> single links of this kind may
occasionally be found incorrectly classified under the
title of "pendants." Those in existence display a
variety of very remarkable formations, for seldom are
the links exactly alike: generally a large and a small
motive are arranged alternately&mdash;a larger and more
richly decorated central link being inserted into the
middle of the chain for the purpose of supporting or
introducing the rich pendent jewel. To this type belongs
one of the most noteworthy necklaces in existence,
which now forms part of the Adolphe Rothschild
Bequest in the Louvre. It is of gold set with pearls
and precious stones, and is composed of twenty-two open-work
links and a pendant, all enamelled in relief, the
eleven larger links and the pendant containing each in
separate compositions a story from the history of the
Passion. The groups of figures are of wonderful
execution, and in spite of their minute proportions are
singularly expressive, being worked in a delicate and at
the same time most resolute manner. When exhibited
by the Countess of Mount Charles at the Jewellery
Exhibition at South Kensington in 1872, the jewel was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span>
thus referred to: "This superb specimen of Italian
Cinquecento work has been attributed to Benvenuto
Cellini, and is at least as good as anything extant
known to be by his hand." This cautious observation
need not disconcert one; for the jewel is too closely
allied in style and workmanship to the jewellery of South
Germany of the second half of the sixteenth century to
permit of such attribution. Nevertheless it must certainly
be reckoned among the most elaborate examples
of Cinquecento jewellery that have come down to us.</p>

<p>The great display of necklaces and long neck-chains
ceased about the middle of the seventeenth century.
In common with other similar objects they entirely disappeared
in England during the Protectorate; nor were
they ever worn again in any greater profusion than
they are at the present day.</p>

<p class="center"><b>RENAISSANCE NECK-PENDANTS</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE necklaces, collars, or neck-chains which have
just been spoken of as noticeable features in
Renaissance decoration served the purpose of
suspending a species of ornament even more peculiarly
characteristic of the period&mdash;the pendant. This was
hung either to the necklet, or to the neck-chain that
fell upon the breast. Among all classes of Renaissance
jewellery, and indeed of the jewellery of all time, this
neck-pendant certainly deserves the first place, not only
on account of the predominating part it played among
the other ornaments of the period, but also on account
of the great number of examples we possess of it, and
the variety of forms which it exhibits.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages almost every pendant
worn at the neck (<i>pent-&agrave;-col</i>) bore a religious signification,
but towards the close of the fifteenth or the beginning
of the sixteenth century the pendant seems to
have lost much of its religious character, and became
mainly an object of decoration. That even in the sixteenth
century it did not entirely serve a decorative
purpose is shown by a number of portraits dating from
the first half of the century, where the termination of
the neck-chain is hidden beneath a square-cut bodice.
What the object was which was thus concealed is
uncertain. It was very possibly a reliquary, or perhaps
a cross; for crosses form a very large proportion of
Renaissance pendants existing at the present day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span></p><p>Apart from crosses, the majority of Renaissance
pendants represent a figured subject of some description,
while compositions entirely of precious stones
appear to be less common&mdash;at least in the second half
of the sixteenth century, to which the greater number of
these jewels belong. Holbein's designs for pendants,
on the other hand, were composed, it may be remembered,
mainly of precious stones. From this we may
infer that jewels having as a central ornament a single
precious stone, or a gem surrounded by stones, and a
regular contour, generally antedate those with figured
compositions within uneven or broken borders. This
of course applies to jewels which exhibit distinctly a
back and front, and not to those formed of a single
figure in the round, which are often difficult to date,
though extant examples belong mostly to the latter half
of the century.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the majority of pendants
are suspended by two, or sometimes three, richly jewelled
and enamelled chains, connected above by a cartouche
similarly enriched. While sixteenth-century pendants
display on their front the art of the goldsmith-enameller
in its full perfection, the reverse likewise exhibits
artistic work in engraving as well as enamelling. It is
likewise worthy of remark that Renaissance pendants
are almost invariably enriched with pendent pearls.</p>

<p>Of the immense number of subjects represented on
these jewels we have already spoken in the introduction
to the jewellery of the period. For pendants formed of
single figures executed in the round, the whole of
ancient or medi&aelig;val imagery&mdash;with its figures of Pan
or of wood-nymphs, centaurs, tritons, or mermen;
nereids, mermaids or sirens; hippocamps, unicorns,
dragons, and other creatures, real as well as fabulous,
of the earth, air, or sea&mdash;was revived, or else transformed
to suit the fancy of the Renaissance jeweller.
The formation of many of these was frequently suggested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span>by a monster pearl, unsuitable for ordinary
jewellery on account of its baroque or misshapen form,
introduced in a wonderfully skilful manner into the
body or breast of a figure, which was completed in
enamelled goldwork. In such adaptations the German
jewellers, who seem to have revelled in technical difficulties,
displayed extraordinary ingenuity.</p>

<p>Among groups of several figures employed as subjects
for representation, generally within a frame of
ornamental design, scenes from ancient mythology predominate,
the Judgment of Paris being a very favourite
theme. But Christian allegories are not excluded:
besides the frequent representation of Charity with her
two children or her symbol the pelican, we find Faith,
Hope, and Fortitude; St. George and the Dragon or
St. Michael are also frequently met with; while amongst
scriptural subjects of the Old and New Testaments or
the Apocrypha, the Annunciation is perhaps the most
popular.</p>

<span class="caption">german and french renaissance pendants</span>
</div>

</div>

<p>The majority of the pendants of this class show a
rich and uneven outline broken by tendrils often enriched
with small dots of enamel, by projecting wings
of birds or amorini, by strapwork and other ornament.
Occasionally a "Charity" or an "Annunciation" is
placed in an architectural niche, but the architectural
device is not infrequently limited to a horizontal beam
formed of a row of table-cut stones and two obelisks of
the same construction forming the ends to the right and
left (Pl. XXXIII, 1). It is only in the smaller examples
of pendants that we find the design lying flat on a plane.
Generally the jewel is fashioned in relief by means of
two, three, or even four superimposed planes formed of
open-work plates arranged in such a manner that the
lower parts are seen through openings in the upper.
These are fastened together by rivets sometimes three-eighths
of an inch long, and the upper field of the
jewel, on which are groups of enamelled figures, is set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span>with stones in very large pyramidal collets, so that the
whole composition is increased to a considerable height.
Collections contain frequent examples of this class of pendant
(Pl. XXXII). One of the most elaborate, of Augsburg
work dating from the end of the sixteenth century,
is in the Adolphe Rothschild Bequest in the Louvre.
In the centre is an enamelled group representing the
Annunciation, within an architectural framework set
with diamonds, rubies, and pendent pearls. The jewel,
which is suspended by triple chains from an enamelled
cartouche, measures in its total length 5&frac14; inches. It
was formerly in the Debruge-Dum&eacute;nil Collection.
Similarly large open-work pendants, enriched with
enamels, precious stones, and pendent pearls, are shown
attached by a ribbon to the left breast in three portraits
dated 1609, representing the Princesses Elizabeth,
Hedwig, and Dorothea of Brunswick, Nos. 458, 460,
and 461 in the Hampton Court Gallery.</p>

<p>Of pendants containing groups of small enamelled
figures there seems to have been an enormous production
in Southern Germany towards the close of the
sixteenth century, particularly in the workshops of
Munich and Augsburg. These pieces, which are very
charming, are greatly sought after by collectors, and are
among the most highly prized of all objects of virtu at
the present day. Their workmanship is extraordinarily
elaborate; though not a few of them, it must be confessed,
are overloaded with detail, and somewhat unsatisfactory
in composition.</p>

<p>With the revival of the glyptic art, cameos begin to
play a prominent part in jewellery. A considerable
number of cameos in the great gem collections, set in exquisite
jewelled and enamelled mounts, are provided with
loops for use as pendants.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Numerous gems, splendidly
mounted as pendants, are to be found in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale at Paris (Pl. XXXI, 6); and in the British
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span>Museum are a few fine examples from the Carlisle Collection.
Of extant pendants having as a centre-piece a
figured subject, either cut in cameo or of repouss&eacute;
work enamelled, the majority show uneven contours,
generally of broken strapwork, after the manner of the
German ornamentists, though not a few of those of
oval shape have frames with smooth outlines. Many,
on the other hand, follow the cartouche design in form
of shields with upturned edges. These figure chiefly in
the designs of the French <i>ma&icirc;tres ornemanistes</i>, Androuet
Ducerceau and Woeiriot. The doubling of the
frame characteristic of the French cartouches, and the
broken contours of the German pendants, which allow
of a variety of intertwinings and traversings, offer a
favourite field for the display of the jeweller's art in
the application of polychrome enamels.</p>

<p>The "nef," or model of a ship, was of frequent
use as an article of table plate. Pendent jewels likewise
take the form of a small ship completely equipped,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
suspended by chains, and hung with pearls. In this
style of jewel, which is perhaps of Venetian origin, the
crescent-shaped caravel or carvel, open and without a
deck, but built up high at the prow and stern, with
forecastle and cabin, and large ship's lantern, is often
adhered to; but the design is not infrequently somewhat
conventional. Many of the best-known collections
contain examples of these "nef" or "navette" pendants.
Their probable Adriatic origin is evinced by the several
specimens exhibited, together with jewels from the
Greek Islands, in the Franks Bequest in the British
Museum. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains
a choice example from the Spitzer Collection. It carries
three masts, five sails, a lantern, and a high poop and
stern. The rigging is of twisted gold wire, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span>hull covered with an imbricated pattern in translucent
blue, red, and green, and opaque white enamels. A
variety to this form is presented by a remarkable piece
in the museum at Vienna. It represents a barque
manned by two rowers; while at the prow and stern are
mandoline players who entertain two passengers seated
beneath the framework awning such as was in use on
the gondolas of the time. The whole is enriched with
polychrome enamels. The figures are in full relief, and
the boat, hung by three chains, is further set with
diamonds and rubies. We may estimate the extraordinary
value attached to such objects at the present
day by the fact that a jewel very similar to this last was
sold at Messrs. Christie's Rooms in the autumn of 1903
for no less a sum than &pound;6,500. The hull of this jewel
is identical with that at Vienna, but figures of Antony
and Cleopatra, finely executed, though somewhat out of
proportion to the rest, here take the place of the couple
beneath the awning; while instead of being hung by
chains (as is suitable to this form of pendant) the jewel
is backed by a composition of scroll-&nbsp;and strap-work,
characteristic of German and Flemish work of the
second half of the sixteenth century. A comparison
with contemporary designs clearly associates these two
objects with the well-known set of engravings for
pendent jewels published by Hans Collaert at Antwerp
in 1581 (Pl. XXXIII). Another version of this jewel
is in the Bavarian National Museum, Munich. The
figures are the same as on the Vienna jewel, but the
vessel is in the form of a fish.</p>

<p>Just as the great gem cabinets preserve pendants
whose jewel-work is confined to richly decorated frames,
so there exist a considerable number of mounted
medals, which must be looked for in collections of
coins and medals, among which they are classed on
account of the presumed preponderating importance of
their centre-pieces. These pendent gold medals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span>(<i>Gnadenmedaillen</i>), with beautiful jewelled and enamelled
mounts, occasionally hung with pearls and suspended
by chains from ornate cartouches, were much in
favour in Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and were given by noble personages, whose
portraits were figured on them, as presents and as marks
of special distinction. Many examples, as is to be expected,
are to be found in the coin cabinets of Munich
and Berlin; while others are preserved in the more important
public and private collections of jewellery.</p>

<p>These medallions, as was natural, were frequently
made in duplicate, and the Waddesdon Bequest, and
the Salting and Pierpont Morgan collections each contain
a jewel, dated 1612, of Maximilian, Archduke of
Austria (1558-1620), in an open-worked border of enamelled
scrolls interrupted by four shields of arms, and
suspended by three chains, united above by an oval
escutcheon with the arms of Austria on one side and the
cross of the Teutonic order on the other. The Victoria
and Albert Museum has an enamel-mounted medal of
Albert VI, Duke of Bavaria (1584-1666), a facsimile of
which, hung with a single instead of trilobed pearl, is
in the Munich cabinet.</p>

<p>Many of the motives connected with pendants denote
associations which appear inexplicable, until it is understood
that no small number of them, like the pendent
medals, were gifts from princes, the so-called "faveurs"
granted in recognition of services rendered. Among
the princely gifts we must class that large group of
pendants which consist only of one letter or a monogram
in an ornamental frame or in open-work, sometimes
composed entirely of precious stones. Of these
the Victoria and Albert Museum possesses a fine early
example in form of a square tablet of gold set with
pearls, bearing on one side two enamelled shields of
arms, and on the other the initials DA, in a frame
formed of bracket-shaped terminal figures and human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span>masks. It is of German work of about the year 1530
(Pl. XXXI, 3). Distinct from these princely monograms
are those employed for religious purposes, particularly
the monograms of Christ and the Virgin.</p>

</div>

<p>Probably the finest example of the numerous
pendants in the form of a single figure, particularly of
those whose formation is suggested by a large baroque
pearl, is the triton or merman jewel in the possession
of Lord Clanricarde. The figure, whose body is made
of a single pearl, with head and arms of white enamel
and tail of brilliant yellow, green, and blue, wields a
jaw-bone in the right hand, and an enamelled satyr's
mask as a shield in the left. This magnificent Italian
jewel was brought from India by Lord Canning. Pendants
of somewhat similar character, often representing
a mermaid holding a comb in one hand and a mirror in
the other, are to be found in the Vienna, Windsor,
Waddesdon, and other collections. They are almost
invariably of German workmanship. Amongst many other
jewels of similar formation the most important is a pendant
in the form of a dragon in the Galerie d'Apollon of
the Louvre. The modelling and general form of this
jewel is very fine, and its enamel-work, chiefly of white
and light blue, in the design of circles and chevrons,
especially on the wings, is most admirable. It is Spanish
work of the highest quality, and was bequeathed by
Baron Davillier, who procured it in Spain (<i>Frontispiece</i>).</p>

<p>Of other animal forms are those of a lion, a dromedary,
a dog (termed a talbot) (Pl. XXXIV, 2), and a fish;
birds include, besides a dove (the symbol of the Holy
Ghost), eagles, cocks, parrots, and pelicans. Fine examples
of the two latter are at South Kensington from the
Treasury at Saragossa: one is mounted with a large hyacinth
in front<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> (Pl. XXXIV, 1), the other is represented
plucking at a blood-red carbuncle set in her breast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span></p><p>Among miscellaneous pendants worn in Renaissance
times attached to the neck-chain mention must be
made of whistles. These (like the "bo'sons pipe" of
to-day) were formed, as has been shown (p. 190), of a
pipe or tube, sometimes in the form of a pistol, through
which the air is carried into a hole in a ball, thus producing
the sound. Whistles of this kind were designed
by D&uuml;rer and Brosamer, and they are shown suspended
at the neck in the engraved portraits of William, Duke
of Juliers, and of John of Leyden by Aldegrever, in the
portrait of a man by Lucis Cranach the elder (1472-1553)
in the Louvre, and in portraits of the Margrave
Philibert of Baden (1549) by Hans Sch&ouml;pfer the elder
at Munich and Nuremberg. Silver whistles of somewhat
similar construction, ornamented with a mermaid
or siren, or with a lion or sea-horse, were frequently
worn also as charms in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. They are usually hung with little bells,
possibly for the purpose of averting the evil eye&mdash;the
"mal'occhio" or "jettatura" it is termed in Italy.
Examples are preserved in the Cluny, Nuremberg, and
South Kensington museums.</p>

<p>In Aldegrever's design for a whistle, of the year
1539, the lower part is formed of a case containing
small articles for toilet purposes. Such articles, in the
shape of toothpicks and ear-picks, often richly gemmed
and enamelled, were very commonly worn hanging
from a fine gold chain or thread about the neck.
Elaborate toothpicks are occasionally seen in pictures,
as in the Venetian portrait of a young man in the
National Gallery of Ireland. Their owners are sometimes
shown affectionately toying with them. Judging
by the frequency with which they are met with in
inventories, they must have been extremely popular. A
few quotations may be given. Thus: Henry VIII
(1530). "Two gold toothpicks with H and E&mdash;A gold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span>toothpick and an ear-pick, with a chain; and two other
toothpicks, one with a ruby and a pearl, and the other
with a ruby and a diamond&mdash;Two gold whistles."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Queen
Elizabeth amongst her New Year's gifts received the
following:&mdash;1573-4: "Six smale tothe-picks of golde.
Geven by Mrs. Snowe, one of them lost by her Majestie."
1574-5: "An eare-picke of golde enamuled, garnished
with sparcks of rubyes, blue saphirs, and seede perle."
1576-7: "A tothe and eare-picke of golde, being a
dolphin enamuled, with a perle pendaunte, 16 small
rubyes being but sparcks, and 5 sparcks of dyamonds."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
Most of the important collections of Cinquecento jewellery
contain specimens of these magnificent toothpicks.
The form is often that of a mermaid or merman. The
body is constructed of a baroque pearl; the tail terminates
in a point. Designs for a couple of jewels of
this kind were published by Erasmus Hornick of Nuremberg
in 1562. In the Cluny Museum (Wasset Bequest)
is a silver-gilt pendant, an ear-&nbsp;and toothpick combined,
one end being an ear-, the other a toothpick. It is ornamented
in the centre with clasped hands and hung with
a pearl, and is German work of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>In addition to the museums already mentioned
(namely, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the
Vienna Museum, the Rothschild and Davillier Bequests
in the Louvre, and the coin or gem collections of
London, Paris, Berlin, and Munich), numbers of pendants,
in immense variety of form, are to be found
in all the well-known collections. The Waddesdon
Bequest in the British Museum contains, perhaps, the
largest series; while the Wallace Collection, the Prussian
Crown Treasury at Berlin, the Bavarian Crown Treasury
at Munich, and the Green Vaults at Dresden, all possess
a great number of examples.</p>

<p>Several English pendants of the Renaissance claim
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_252" id="page_252">{252}</a></span>attention for their rare beauty and historical importance.
Of the pendants of the time of Henry VIII we
obtain a tolerably accurate idea from contemporary
portraits, and from Holbein's inimitable series of
drawings. The earliest existing example, which, so far
as can be ascertained, dates from the Holbein period,
is known as the Penruddock Jewel. It is believed to have
been presented in 1544 by Queen Catherine Parr to Sir
George Penruddock of Compton Chamberlayne, and Anne
his wife. It is triangular in shape, and set with a large
cabochon sapphire surrounded by rubies and diamonds in
open-work enamel setting. This remarkable jewel is shown
on a portrait of Sir George Penruddock by Lucas de Heere
in possession of its owner, Mr. Charles Penruddock, at
Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire.</p>

</div>

<p>The majority of English sixteenth-century pendants
extant date from the Elizabethan period, and are almost
all more or less associated with the Virgin Queen. The
ingenuity displayed in devising curious forms for these
ornaments can best be judged from the lists of the
Queen's own jewels. A few of these may be mentioned:
"A juell of golde, being a catt, and myce playing with
her.&mdash;One greene frog, the back of emeraldes, smale and
greate, and a pendaunte emeralde, and a smale cheyne
of golde to hang by.&mdash;A juell of golde, being an anker."
Another "being a dolfyn," another "two snakes wounde
together," others take the form of a horse-shoe, a swan,
and a rainbow.</p>

<p>The "nef" jewel, of which we have spoken, was also
a favourite one. In the Queen's inventory are a number
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span>of entries of this class of pendant, and among them:
"A jeuel of golde, being a shippe, sett with a table
dyamonde, of fyve sparcks of dyamondes, and a smale
perle pendaunte.&mdash;A juell, being a ship of mother-of-perle,
garneshed with small rubys, and 3 small diamonds."
One of the chief treasures among the Hunsdon heirlooms
at Berkeley Castle is a pendant of this form, a
present to Elizabeth from Sir Francis Drake, and given
by her to Lord Hunsdon. It is supposed to represent
the famous <i>Golden Hind</i>, the ship in which Drake
sailed round the world. The hull, which is of ebony,
is set with a table diamond; the masts and rigging of
gold are enriched with blue, white, green, and black
opaque enamels, and set with seed pearls. In the ship
is a seated figure of Victory blowing a horn, and behind
is a cherub crowning her with a wreath. The small
boat suspended below is enamelled blue (Pl. XXXV, 2).</p>

<p>A jewel also associated with Sir Francis Drake, and
perhaps the most important of all Elizabethan pendants,
is preserved, with other relics of the great navigator, at
Nutwell Court, Devon. It is set in front with a fine
Renaissance cameo in Oriental sardonyx, representing
two heads&mdash;a negro in the upper and dark layer, and a
classical head in the light layer of the stone. Behind is
a miniature by Hilliard of Elizabeth, dated 1575. The
border, of most admirable work, is richly enamelled in
red, yellow, blue, and green, interspersed with diamonds
and rubies. Beneath is a cluster pendant of pearls, to
which is attached a very fine drop pearl (Pl. XXXIV, 4).
This magnificent jewel was presented to Sir Francis
Drake by Queen Elizabeth in 1579, and in his portrait
by Zucchero (now belonging, together with the jewel, to
his descendant Sir F. Fuller-Eliott-Drake) he is represented
wearing it suspended from the neck by a red and
gold cord, over a silk scarf, also a present from the Queen.</p>

<p>The cluster of pearls, as on the Drake Jewel, was a
favourite form of ornament for Renaissance pendants.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span>In the National Portrait Gallery is a portrait of Henry
Grey, Duke of Suffolk (father of Lady Jane Grey),
wearing a George of the Order of the Garter, below
which is hung a pearl cluster and a large pear-shaped
pearl attached. A similar pendant, like a bunch of
grapes, serves to enrich another fine jewel of this time&mdash;the
Barbor Jewel in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
In the centre of this jewel is a beautifully cut cameo
portrait in sardonyx of Queen Elizabeth in a frame of
translucent blue and green on opaque white enamel,
set alternately with rubies and table diamonds. According
to a family tradition, Mr. William Barbor, who had
been condemned to be burned at the stake in Smithfield
for his religion, had this jewel made to commemorate
his deliverance through the death of Queen Mary and
the accession of Elizabeth (Pl. XXXV, 4).</p>

<p>The Museum at South Kensington exhibits another
pendant of the same period, the property of Miss Wild.
It is of gold, of open scrollwork, enamelled, and set
with rubies and diamonds, and with pearl drops. It
has in the centre a turquoise cameo of Queen Elizabeth.
The sheen of the pearls with the rich red of the foiled
rubies and the dark lustre of the diamonds in their old
irregular setting, combine with the lightness and delicacy
of the goldwork touched with coloured enamel to
render this little pendant one of the most attractive
objects of its kind in existence. In addition to its
artistic beauty, the jewel is of interest from the tradition
that it was given as a christening present by Queen
Elizabeth to its first owner, by whose descendants it
has been preserved to the present day.</p>

<p>Amongst other examples in that important group of
jewels which were apparently intended either as special
rewards to naval officers or simply as complimentary
presents from the Queen to Court favourites, the finest
are the Ph&oelig;nix Jewel in the British Museum, a jewel
belonging to Mr. Pierpont Morgan, and one in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span>Poldi-Pezzoli Museum, Milan. The Ph&oelig;nix Jewel,
bequeathed to the British Museum by Sir Hans Sloane
in 1753, has as a central ornament a gold bust of Queen
Elizabeth cut from a gold medal known as the Ph&oelig;nix
Badge of the year 1574, bearing on the reverse the
device of a ph&oelig;nix amid flames. It is enclosed in an
enamelled wreath set on both sides with red, white, and
variegated roses symbolising the union of the Houses
of York and Lancaster. The roses, of translucent red
and opaque white enamel, and the leaves, of translucent
green on engraved ground, are attached to stalks covered
with lighter green opaque enamel (Pl. XXXV, 1). The
workmanship of this jewel is extremely fine, and on a
level in point of excellence with the Eliott-Drake pendant
and with Mr. Pierpont Morgan's Armada Jewel.</p>

<p>Of the last-named&mdash;a splendid production of an
English goldsmith of the Elizabethan period&mdash;it is
impossible to speak with adequate praise. Like the
Ph&oelig;nix Jewel, it is modelled upon a contemporary
medal, though in an entirely different style. Upon the
front is a profile bust of Queen Elizabeth from the
Personal or Garter badge of 1582, upon an enamelled
ground of aventurine blue, inscribed with the royal
title. The opposite side forms a locket containing a
miniature of Elizabeth by Hilliard dated 1580, and
covered with a lid enamelled with translucent colours&mdash;on
the outside with the Ark and the motto <span class="smcap">saevas
tranquilla per undas</span> (as on the "Naval Award
Medal" of 1588), and on the inside with the Tudor
rose and a laudatory Latin motto&mdash;the same as appears
round the reverse of the Ph&oelig;nix Badge of 1574, which
refers to Elizabeth with a regret "that virtue endued
with so much beauty should not uninjured enjoy perpetual
life." The jewel is bordered by strapwork <i>&agrave;
jour</i> of opaque blue and white enamel set with table
diamonds and rubies. This exquisite object, which
is in the highest possible state of preservation, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span>retains its fine enamel entirely uninjured, was sold at
Messrs. Christie's in July, 1902, for the large sum of
&pound;5,250 (Pl. XXXIV, 5, 6).</p>

<p>The third jewel of this class, also undoubtedly
English, is in the Poldi-Pezzoli Museum at Milan. It
has in the centre a mother-of-pearl medallion with the
Ark carved in low relief, of the same design as on the
Morgan Jewel and the 1588 medal, surrounded by the
like inscription&mdash;<span class="smcap">saevas tranqvila per vndas</span>&mdash;in gold
on white enamel, and encircled by a band of table-cut
rubies. The edge is enamelled with translucent red and
green, and opaque white enamel (Pl. XXXV, 3). The
Ark floating tranquilly amid violent waves is emblematic
of the fortunes of England, or possibly of Elizabeth,
who, according to the legend <span class="smcap">per tot discrimina
rerum</span> which appears on the back of the jewel, had
sailed triumphantly through many dangers. No
account of this important object has previously been
published, nor has its nationality up to the present
been noticed, or at any rate recorded.</p>

<p>The front opens on a hinge, and shows that the
pendant was intended as a miniature case&mdash;though the
miniature is missing. In the times of Elizabeth and
her successor miniature cases were among the most
important of pendent jewels. Quite a number have
survived, chiefly on account of the miniatures they
enclose. Contemporary portraits show the manner in
which they were worn. In the catalogue of Charles I's
collections a miniature of Queen Elizabeth is thus
described: "Queen Elizabeth ... very richly adorned
with gold and pearls, and a picture-box hanging at her
right breast." Such "picture boxes," with backs elaborately
enamelled by the champlev&eacute; method, leaving
only thin outlines of gold of scroll design, and hinged
fronts of open-work, enamelled and set with precious
stones, are among the presents which appear to have
been frequently conferred as marks of recognition on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span>favourite courtiers or subjects. It is impossible to
enumerate all the various examples in public and
private collections. The Victoria and Albert Museum
possesses one of the best, and a beautiful specimen is
preserved at Windsor Castle<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> (Pl. XXVIII, 5). A description
of a third jewel of the kind, the "Lyte Jewel,"
will be given subsequently (p. 303).</p>

<p>Besides the enamelled and jewelled pendants there
are various medals (some of which have been alluded
to) suspended by a ring or chain and worn as badges by
those who were personally attached to the Queen; and
to the time of James I belong numerous references to
medals of gold with the "King's Majestie's phisnomy"
on them, mostly the work of his goldsmith, John
Williams, and presented to various foreigners in official
positions.</p>

<p>Space does not permit of detailed description of the
wonderful Lennox or Darnley Jewel at Windsor Castle,

Walpole's collection at Strawberry Hill in 1842
(Pl. XXVIII, 4). The jewel has been fully described by

<p>It has been impossible here to convey an adequate
idea of all the various specimens of sixteenth-century
pendants that exist at the present day. Attention has
been drawn to a few of the most striking examples
which stand out above the rest, either by reason of the
beauty of their design or the superlative excellence of
their workmanship, or by reason of their unique historical
interest. While indicating the great public collections
where these things are preserved, it must be left
to amateurs to discover and appreciate for themselves,
as they are bound to do, what, owing to exigencies of
space, we are precluded from referring to in detail.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="center"><b>RENAISSANCE RINGS, BRACELETS, AND BROOCHES</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE splendour-loving sixteenth century far surpassed
the Middle Ages in the use of the finger
ring. No other ornament of the Renaissance
attained such richness and profusion. In sixteenth
and seventeenth century portraits rings are represented
in such quantities that the hands appear overburdened
with them; while the number entered in the old inventories
is astounding. Yet it is well to remember
that the word <i>bague</i>, which we translate a ring, was a
general term for all pendent jewels&mdash;though not infrequently
a distinction in the lists is drawn between
<i>bague &agrave; mettre aux oreilles</i> (an earring), <i>bague &agrave; pendre</i>
(a pendant), and <i>bague &agrave; mettre au doigt</i>. The extraordinary
abundance of finger rings in use at the time
may best be judged by a list in the inventory of
Henry VIII of the year 1530, which contains no less
than 234.</p>

<p>Of the large number of Renaissance rings that have survived
to the present day most are of a purely ornamental
character; and though many others are of interest on
account of their emblematic or historical associations,
those which display artistic work require the chief
consideration. Out of all the rings that simply served the
purpose of decoration, there are very few whose nationality
can be easily determined. If it is difficult in the
case of pendants and similar ornaments to come to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span>decision with regard to the question of provenance, it is
even more so where rings are concerned.</p>

<p>Pictures of the period, as has been said, represent
persons with their hands heavily loaded with rings,
which are worn upon all the fingers, the thumb included.
Every finger-joint up to the very nail is
covered with them, and they are worn, as by the
ancient Romans, even upon the knuckles. The great
projection of the rings' bezels would have rendered the
use of gloves impossible, were it not, as we know from
pictures, for the custom of placing the rings outside the
gloves, and also for the somewhat ugly fashion of
slitting the fingers of the gloves, in order that they
might be worn with greater comfort, and allow the
rings themselves to be displayed. In a portrait of a
lady by Lucas Cranach in the National Gallery, rings
are worn both over and beneath the gloves, every finger
and the thumbs having two or three. The rings under
the gloves appear on the top of the second knuckle of
every finger, and are visible through the <i>crev&eacute;s</i> made in
the gloves at these points. In other pictures by this
artist, such as that entitled "Judith" at Vienna, and in
the works of his contemporaries in Germany, the same
slashed gloves are to be seen. Men's gloves, too, like
their doublets, were slashed, as is clear from the engraved
portrait of Duke William of Juliers, by Aldegrever.
Bishop Hall (<i>Satires</i>, <span class="smcap">III</span>, iv) refers thus
to the current fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Nor can good Myson wear on his left hond,<br />

But he must cut his glove to show his pride,<br />
That his trim jewel might be better spy'd.</div></div></div>

<p>The tendency of placing the stone in a very high
bezel was a tradition from the Middle Ages, where a
preference had always been shown for the stone being
so set. The ornamental rings of the Renaissance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span>followed a uniform outline as far as their bezels and
settings were concerned. They contained, as a rule, one
stone only, backed by a foil or <i>paillon</i>, and set in a
box-like collet, square and pyramidal, and closed behind.
The gold was rubbed over the setting edge of the stone,
and the four side surfaces then decorated in a variety of
ways by the application of enamel, and sometimes overlaid
with an additional ornamentation in imitation of
claws. The stone itself, usually table-cut, was frequently
a ruby.</p>

<p><a name="img260" id="img260"></a></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption1">Triple rings set with pointed diamonds.
Device of Cosimo de' Medici. (Figured in Botticelli's "Pallas"
in the Pitti Gallery.)</span>
</div>

<p>One peculiar variety of ring, known from the early
part of the fifteenth century, is deserving of note. Its
design was founded upon the natural octahedrite shape
of the diamond, and was distinguished by a very high
bezel, which received one half of the octahedron and
allowed the other to project upwards. Rings set thus
with pointed diamonds were in high favour until the middle of
the seventeenth century, and were employed for writing upon
glass&mdash;a practice which appears to have been much in
vogue. The most characteristic examples of the <i>diamante in
punta</i> were those adopted by the Medici as their device.
Three diamond rings interlaced were employed by Cosimo
(d. 1464); Piero took one diamond
ring held in the claw of a falcon; Lorenzo continued
the device of the ring, in which he placed three feathers.
The best-known representations of these three devices
are figured in Paolo Giovio's <i>Dialogo dell' imprese</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to the case for the stone, the sides or
"shoulders" of the ring which held it were the subject
of special artistic development. They took the form of
small figures, winged creature, masks, and other ornaments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span>in relief and richly enamelled; while for smooth
surfaces champlev&eacute; enamel was employed in a variety
of designs. So extraordinarily elaborate is the work
on some of these rings that it would almost seem as if
they were produced rather as examples of the skill of the
craftsman than as objects for actual use.</p>

<p>Several old portraits exhibit rings strung upon
men's necklaces, or hung from a thin cord round the
neck. A portrait by Mabuse, in the Berlin Gallery,
shows a ring worn thus, and in two portraits by Lucas
Cranach&mdash;one at Weimar, representing Johann Friedrich
of Saxony attired as a bridegroom, and the other
at Dresden, of the Elector Johann the Constant of
Saxony (1526)&mdash;rings are hung similarly round the
neck. Rings were also worn in the hat. A particularly
striking example of this fashion is seen in the portrait
of Bernhard III, Margrave of Baden, 1515, by Hans
Baldung Grien, in the Pinakothek, Munich. Around
his cap is fixed a thick wire-shaped band of gold, with
a strip of cloth wound spirally round it. The latter
serves to fix at regular intervals four gold rings, three
of them set with cabochon stones and the fourth with
a pointed diamond. A similar kind of decoration is
alluded to in Gabriel Harvey's <i>Letter Book</i>, 1574
(Camden Society, 1884, p. 145), where a servant is mentioned
carrying to a maiden an enamelled posy ring
which his master had worn sewn upon his hat.</p>

<p>The rings worn thus were in many cases betrothal
or engagement rings; but those that served this
purpose generally assumed special forms, and were
among the most ingenious productions of the time.
They were composed of twin or double hoops, and
known as gimmel rings. The outer side of the two
hoops was convex and elaborately ornamented, while
the inner side was flat and often bore some inscription.
The two hoops were wrought so exactly alike, that,
together with the stones, they appeared to be one ring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span>yet could be separated, and the one hung from the other.
Their bezels were occasionally formed of clasped hands.
Ordinary one-hoop rings also bore the same design
and were known as "fede" rings. Another kind of
betrothal or engagement ring was the "posy" or
"poesie" ring, generally of simple form, with a verse,
a name, or a motto engraved inside it. The posy ring,
suitably inscribed, was also used as a wedding-ring.
The simple posy ring belongs, however, chiefly to the
seventeenth century. The elaborate betrothal ring
seems to have been employed at this time as a wedding-ring
as well. It was reserved for modern times to give
the wedding-ring its smooth, convenient, but artistically
unimportant form. Widely distributed among the
North German peasantry are certain peculiar wedding-rings,
which, as a rule, contain a couple of the heart-shaped
milk-teeth of the young roe-buck, with a small
lock from which hang two keys&mdash;a symbol which perhaps
not inaptly indicates the union of two pure hearts.
Dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
but wholly different from the Renaissance form of ring,
and very large and elaborate, are the Jewish wedding-rings,
which were used only at the ceremony and then
preserved by the family. They are composed of a broad
band adorned with filigree (probably in keeping with
some ancient Oriental tradition) arranged in bosses and
rosettes and enriched with light blue, light green, and
other enamel. In place of a bezel there is often the
model of a building with high gabled roofs and
enamelled tile, pierced by windows, and having
movable weathercocks on the apex; an inscription in
Hebrew characters on the shank contains the motto
"Good star."</p>

<p>It was the custom to arrange finger rings upon a rod
when not in use or when exposed for exhibition in the
jeweller's shop, and in paintings it is no uncommon
thing to see a line of rings of various patterns run on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span>what appears to be a roll of parchment; as in the
annexed illustration&mdash;a cut from a Herbal published
at Frankfort in 1536. Rings arranged thus may be seen in
Ghirlandaio's portrait of Costanza de' Medici, belonging
to Mr. Salting; in the "Legend of St. Godeberta" by Petrus
Christus; in Gerard David's portrait of a goldsmith
at Vienna; in the "Banker and his Wife" by Quentin Matsys
in the Louvre, and in similar pictures where
a jeweller or a banker is represented.</p>

<span class="caption1">Rings on a roll of parchment.
From <i>Kreuterbuch</i> (Frankfort, 1536).</span>
</div>

<p>In Henry VIII's inventory of 1527 we find: "Upon
a finger-stall, seven rings, one a ruby, another an
emerald, and a turquoise, another a table diamond,
another a triangular diamond, another a rocky diamond";
also in 1530: "A roll with thirty-nine Paris
rings, with small stones." In the Duke of Newcastle's
comedy <i>The Country Captain</i> (1649) mention is made
of an extravagant person "who makes his fingers like
jewellers' cards to set rings upon." In the Pinakothek,
Munich, is a most interesting picture by Paris Bordone
representing a jeweller with a quantity of his treasures
lying on a table before him. Every item is painted
with extreme care. Twelve massive finger rings, arranged
in three rows of four, are displayed in an oblong
ring-box, just in the same manner as one might expect
to find them in a jeweller's shop of the present day. A
somewhat similar picture by Lorenzo Lotto, in the
Kaufmann Collection in Berlin, represents a jeweller
holding in his left hand a box full of rings and in his
right a single specimen.</p>

<p>By far the most attractive of the fine engravings of
jewellery by Pierre Woeiriot of Lorraine is his beautiful
set of rings published in 1561 under the title of
<i>Livre d'aneaux d'orf&eacute;vrerie</i>. M. Foulc, of Paris, is
generally credited with the possession of the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span>complete set of these engravings. A perfect specimen
of the work is, however, preserved in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, to which it was bequeathed by the
well-known antiquary Francis Douce in 1834. It comprises
forty plates, each containing one or more rings
to the number of ninety-six, and furnishes striking
examples of the taste and inventive genius then
bestowed on these minute objects. Nevertheless, engravings
can convey but small idea of the colour
effect, and the wonderful charm that the actual rings
possess. In order to fully appreciate them, one must
visit the three great English collections of them now
accessible to the public: the South Kensington Collection,
containing the greater part of that formed by
Edmund Waterton; the Drury Fortnum Collection in
the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and above all, the
collection in the British Museum, which includes the
splendid series bequeathed by Sir A. W. Franks, in
which were absorbed the Braybrooke, Londesborough,
and some minor cabinets, together with the best from
the Soden Smith Collection, as well as the choicest
from the Pichon and from many foreign sales.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>BRACELETS</b></p>

<p>The bracelet during this period plays a scarcely
more prominent part than it did in the Middle Ages,
and probably owing to the same reason; for in Renaissance
times the fashion of leaving the arms bare was
not in favour, and the long sleeves that fell over the
hand were retained. A few examples presented by
pictures lead to the supposition that bracelets consisted
of beads of amber or jet separated by balls of gold, or
of rows of cameos. Catarina Cornaro in her portrait
by Titian in the Uffizi wears a bracelet upon her wrist
over the sleeve, while the portrait of a lady by Cranach
in the National Gallery shows that the sleeves were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span>occasionally slashed at the wrists to exhibit the bracelets
beneath them, just as were the fingers of gloves for
the purpose of displaying rings.</p>

<p>Inventories supply a certain amount of information
concerning bracelets. Henry VIII in 1530 possessed
seventeen, including one of "Paris work, with jacynths;
and one with eight diamonds, eight rubies, fourteen
pearls, and a diamond rose." Elizabeth received a
large number of bracelets amongst her New Year's
gifts. In the inventory of Mary Stuart's jewels are
"Une paire de brasseletz garniz de cornaline lappines
et agate et entredeux de doubles&mdash;Une aultre paire de
brasseletz damatiste&mdash;Ung bracelet fait a facon de serpent."
Others are formed, as were necklaces, of beads
of filigree enclosing perfumes: "Deux braceletz dor
percez a jour pleins de parfum&mdash;Une aultre paire dor
a jour empliz de parfum."</p>

<p>References to bracelets by writers of the period show
that they were not infrequently worn as love tokens.
Thus in Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>Cupid's Revenge</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

Which they on our arms shall twist<br />
With our names carv'd on our wrist.</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
I would put amber bracelets on thy wrist,<br />

<p>Contemporary designs prove that bracelets followed
the same elaborate forms as other articles of jewellery,
as may be seen from the engraved designs of Ducerceau,
and the <i>Livre de Bijouterie</i> of Ren&eacute; Boyvin of Angers
(1530-1598).</p>

<p>One of the most interesting bracelets&mdash;as far as
actual specimens are concerned&mdash;is preserved at
Berkeley Castle amongst the heirlooms bequeathed by
George Carey, Lord Hunsdon, who died in 1603. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span>of crystal and gold, 3&frac34; inches in diameter. The crystal,
a complete circlet overlaid with open-work gold, is encrusted
all round with rubies, and has at intervals four
clusters of rubies around a sapphire (Pl. XXXV, 5). It
is somewhat difficult to arrive at a decision as to the
origin of this remarkable object. It seems to bear traces
of Oriental influence in the setting of the stones, though
the goldwork is of different quality from what one would
expect to find in Indian work. If, like the "nef"
jewel at Berkeley, this armlet is to be associated with
Sir Francis Drake, it may well have been obtained by
him as part of some Spanish spoil, in like manner to
the "crystal bracelet set in gold" procured by Sir
Matthew Morgan at the capture of Cadiz in 1596&mdash;Cadiz
being then the staple town for all the trades of
the Levant and of the Indies.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Bracelets formed of cameos are met with sometimes
on portraits. The Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris
preserves a pair of bracelets (Nos. 624 and 625) formed
each of seven oval shell cameos representing figures of
animals, enclosed in gold mounting enriched with blue
enamel, and hinged together by a double chain ornamented
with rosettes enamelled green. On the under
side of the larger cameos which form the clasps are
two interlacing C's within a wreath of palm and olive,
enamelled green, and a barred S in blue enamel at each
angle. These bracelets, of which the cameos as well as
the mountings are of fine sixteenth-century work, have
been traditionally associated with Diana of Poitiers.
But the interlaced C's, according to M. Babelon, are in
all probability the initials of some lady of the family
of Harlay, from whom the bracelets were acquired by
Louis XIV (Pl. XXXVII, 3, 4).</p>

<p>Bracelets, like necklaces, were not infrequently composed
entirely of gold, with interwoven links, like mail-chains.
A chain bracelet of this style, formed of circular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span>fluted links, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Its clasp is enriched with a floral pattern in translucent
champlev&eacute; enamel (Pl. XXXVII, 1). Three similar
bracelets forming part of the Holtzendorff treasure from
Pinnow (Ucker-Mark, N. Germany) are in the Germanic
Museum, Nuremberg. They are composed of circular
links, and have flat clasps like the bracelet just mentioned,
ornamented with coats-of-arms in enamel. One
of them bears the date 1612.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>BROOCHES</b></p>

<p>One of the most important of ornaments throughout
the Middle Ages was the brooch; but towards the
end of the fifteenth century the mode of wearing garments
changed, and the <i>c&ocirc;tehardi</i> having replaced the
mantle, brooches disappeared little by little, till in
Renaissance times they were rarely employed, except
as ornaments for the hat. It is true that sixteenth-century
inventories contain an immense number of
owches and brooches&mdash;Henry VIII had no less than
324&mdash;but nearly all these, the larger ones especially,
were worn as enseignes upon the hat; while the smaller
were employed not as dress fasteners, but simply as
ornaments sewn or pinned at regular intervals upon
the front of the dress or the borders of the sleeves. A
single elaborate jewelled brooch is sometimes seen in
pictures attached to the upper part of the sleeve. We
see it thus on the figure of Arithmetic in Pinturicchio's
famous fresco in the Appartamento Borgia of the Vatican,
and later in English pictures, notably the well-known
painting in Sherborne Castle, Dorset, representing
Queen Elizabeth's procession in litter to Blackfriars in
1600, where the ladies of her retinue have jewels
fastened to the sleeves of their right arms.</p>

<p>The garments of this period were not fastened by
means of brooches, but were closed with buttons or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span>points, or with hooks and eyes. Sleeves were often
held on by buttons to which the sleeve-loops or points
were tied, while other portions of the clothing, especially
if of leather and cumbersome to button, were
secured with loops or hooks and eyes. The slashings
of the dress were sometimes closed by buttons or pompoms
formed of stones surrounded by pearls. Similar
button-like ornaments, jewelled and richly enamelled,
of which examples exist, were worn in rows all over the
dress, but their delicate form and often irregular shape
exclude the supposition that they were used as actual
buttons. Of ornaments of this kind Mary Queen of
Scots possessed a large number: thus&mdash;"Quatre vingtz
bouttons dor esmaillez de blanc et noir garniz de
chacune une perle." Others mentioned in her inventory
are "&agrave; rose garniz de chacun trois perles"; others again
are "percez &agrave; jour esmaillez de noir."</p>

<p>These individual jewelled ornaments, which it was
the practice to sew on the dress at regular intervals by
way of trimming, may be treated as distinct from
ornamentation which formed part of the actual costume,
such as masses of pearls and precious stones, with which
dresses were literally loaded. Individual jewels often
took the form of the monogram, crest, or device of the
owner, in pure gold richly decorated. A curious instance
of this custom has already been alluded to in
connection with what occurred during the masque given
by Henry VIII at Westminster. The fashion for wearing
ornaments in the form of jewelled initials was still
in vogue on the quilted dresses of the time of James I.
Anne of Denmark is represented in her portraits wearing
them both on her ruff and in her hair, and a "jewel,
in form of an A and two CC, sett with diamonds" and
others of similar kind are to be found in the lists of
jewels supplied to the Queen by George Heriot.</p>

<p>Except occasionally for buttons, the chief means
employed for fastening the garments was by <i>aigulets</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span>or <i>aglets</i>. These ornamental loops or eyelets, formed
of cords terminating with goldsmith's work, were movable
and were changed from one dress to another according
to pleasure. They are seen in pictures hanging not
only from slashes and various parts of the garments, but
also from the cap; and Henry VIII is described as
wearing a cap ornamented with gold enamelled tags.
His daughter, the Princess Mary, was supplied in 1542
by her jeweller, Mabell, with two dozen pairs of <i>aglets</i>.
Mary Stuart had a number, such as: "Soixante cinq
esguillettes dor facon de cheuilles sans esmail," "Soixante
une esguillettes dor et de perle esmaillez de
rouge," and "Quatre vingtz dixhuict esguillette dor
esmaillez de blanc et noir." Queen Elizabeth possessed
several sets, of different colours and patterns&mdash;some
gold enamelled white, some blue, others purple, and
some enriched with pearls and precious stones. These
jewelled aglets are now extremely rare, and are not
represented in any public collection.</p>

<p class="center"><b>RENAISSANCE GIRDLES AND GIRDLE PENDANTS</b><br />
<b>(MIRRORS, BOOKS, WATCHES, SCENT-CASES, AND POMANDERS)</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE girdle is an important ornament in the dress
of the Renaissance. From the beginning of the
sixteenth century it differs considerably from
the medi&aelig;val pattern already discussed. In place of
the stiff hoop about the hips, it was worn loosely across
the body from above the right hip down towards the
left thigh, where the upper garment was passed over it
in a light fold. At this point was the clasp, from which
hung numerous small articles necessary to the active
housewife. Another style of wearing it, which appears
to have been adopted for more sumptuous dress, was
one where it more firmly encircled the body, and from
a clasp in front, hung down in a long end, terminating
in a special ornamental appendage&mdash;a scent-case or
pomander.</p>

<p>The common material was leather or stuff, such as
was employed for men's girdles. The long and narrow
thong of leather, termed <i>courroye</i>, was worn by all
classes. Rows of such girdles are figured in the background
of Jost Amman's well-known woodcut of the
<i>ceinturier</i> in his workshop, of the year 1594.</p>

<p>The majority of Renaissance girdles, confined solely
to female attire, were made entirely of silver or silver-gilt,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span>and even of silvered or gilded bronze. They took
the form of flat chains composed of links, generally
with solid pieces in the shape of oblong plaques, of
cast or chased work, introduced at regular intervals.
The solid parts, particularly those that formed the
clasps, were occasionally enriched with enamels,
precious stones, or engraved gems. The majority of
collections contain specimens of such girdles; but
simpler kinds, composed entirely of ring-shaped links,
which, judging from numerous Flemish, Dutch, and
German portraits, must have been in very general use
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, are much
less frequently met with. A good example of such, a
chain in silver-gilt, of German work of the second half
of the sixteenth century, is preserved in the Mus&eacute;e du
Cinquantenaire at Brussels. It is formed of rounded
grooved links. At one end is a rosette-shaped girdle
plate set with a white crystal, and having a hook
behind to catch into any link of the chain. The other
end terminates in a pear-shaped pomander 3&frac12; inches
long, and divided for the reception of different cosmetics
into two parts, united by a screw from below.</p>

<p>A considerable number of girdles of leather or strips
of material are found mounted after the medi&aelig;val style
with buttons or studs, and instead of clasps, have
buckles at one end, and at the other the pendants or
chapes common in earlier times.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to meet with girdles of Flemish or
German work which, though dating from the latter part
of the seventeenth century, are ornamented with Gothic
patterns. The buckle and pendant (<i>mordant</i>), deeply
pierced with open-work tracery of flamboyant design,
are generally united by only a short thong, and are so
overcharged with ornament that it is doubtful if they
could have been of any practical use. Such objects
appear in reality to be but specimens of their work
submitted by girdlers who were desirous of obtaining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span>admission to the Girdlers' Company. They serve to
show how long-lived were Gothic traditions among the
guilds. Examples in silver or bronze gilt are to be
found in the Germanic Museum, Nuremberg, the
Victoria and Albert Museum (No. 2304-'55), the Waddesdon
Bequest (No. 226), dated 1680, the Wallace
Collection (No. 783), dated 1709, and in many other
public collections (Pl. XXXVIII, 3).</p>

<p>A number of articles, both useful and ornamental,
were suspended from the girdle. For practical purposes
the housewife carried at her side, besides a knife, such
objects as small scissors in a case, a purse, and also her
keys. Cases or &eacute;tuis for knives were attached either
by silken cords or by chains. When cords were employed
the cover of the &eacute;tui was furnished with loops
on each side through which the cords slid. Open
quiver-like sheaths for knives hung by chains were
often worn, in order to display the rich decoration of
the knife-heads.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The Italianate costume, such as is found in the type
of "Vanity" in emblem books of the age, and which
made its way everywhere, favoured the addition of
many other accessories to the girdles, such as fans,
gloves, looking-glasses, books, watches, scent-cases,
and pomanders. Mirrors, besides being worn from
the neck, formed, as did miniature-cases, a frequent
pendant from the girdle. These were either in a frame
of ivory or goldsmith's work, or inserted in the fan.
Stubbes, the censor of the follies of his day, speaks of
the looking-glasses which ladies carried with them
"wheresoever they go." Etienne (Stephanus) Delaune
has left eight engraved designs for hand mirrors of
great beauty. Their handles terminate with small rings
for attachment by a chain to the girdle. In the Louvre
is an interesting pendent mirror-case, or rather back of
a mirror, formed of an oval plaque of glass encrusted
with designs in enamel on gold (<i>&eacute;mail en r&eacute;sille sur
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span>verre</i>),<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> bearing the inscription "Grace dedans, le
lis-ha."</p>

<p>Small books, mainly devotional, were also worn at
the girdle. It appears to have been a common practice
for ladies to carry such books, and in Lyly's <i>Euphues</i>
mention is made of "the English damoselles who have
theyr bookes tyed to their gyrdles." Queen Elizabeth
had several. Amongst the "juelles given to her Majestie
at Newyere's-tyde," 1582, was "a litle boke of golde
enamuled, garnished and furnished with smale
diamondes and rubyes, with claspes, and all hanging
at a chayne of golde." The inventory of the
jewels of the Duchess of Somerset, widow of the
Protector, in 1587, likewise contains "a booke of golde
inamyled blacke." Two drawings for small pendent
books intended to be executed in niello or black enamel
appear amongst Holbein's designs for jewellery in the
British Museum; and the Earl of Romney possesses a
small manuscript Prayer Book in binding of enamelled
gold of the same style.</p>

<p>The most magnificent book-cover in existence, provided
with loops for hanging by a chain to the girdle, is
one preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It
is of enamelled, repouss&eacute; gold, and has been ascribed to
Cellini. Of less beauty, though of great interest as an
example of English work, is the gold binding of a
pendent Prayer Book in the British Museum. The
subjects on the sides, raised and enamelled, are the
Brazen Serpent, and the Judgment of Solomon, with
English inscriptions around. It is said to be the work
of George Heriot of Edinburgh;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and there is a tradition
that it was worn by Queen Elizabeth. Whatever
associations this object may have had with Elizabeth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_274" id="page_274">{274}</a></span>there is better authority for such with regard to the
small book of prayers, the property of Lord Fitzhardinge,
and one of the Hunsdon heirlooms. This
very interesting English jewel, measuring 2&frac14; by 2 inches,
is of gold, inlaid with black enamel, with a rosette of
white enamel at each corner. The centre of one cover
is decorated with translucent red and green enamel, that
of the other with a shell cameo. It contains the last
prayer of King Edward VI in MS. written on vellum.
The title runs: "The Prayer of Kynge Edward the VI
which he made the vj of Julij, 1553, and the vij yere
of his raigne, iij howres before his dethe, to him selfe, his
eyes being closed, and thinkinge none had herd him, the
xvj yere of his age." The book was worn by Queen Elizabeth
at her girdle, and came into the Berkeley family
through her cousin, Lord Hunsdon (Pl. XXXV, 7).</p>

<p>The Earl of Leicester, it is recorded, presented
Queen Elizabeth on New Year's Day, 1581, with a long
gold chain set with diamonds and "hanging thereat a
rounde clocke fullie garnished with dyamonodes, and an
appendante of diamondes hanging thearat." Though
occasionally worn thus suspended from the neck-chain,
watches appear to have been more frequently carried at
the girdle&mdash;a position somewhat similar to that which
they subsequently occupied upon the chatelaine.</p>

<p>The honour of the invention of portable timepieces
is probably due to Peter Henlein, of Nuremberg, in the
last quarter of the fifteenth century, but it was not till
a century later that they came into anything like general
use. The cases, which received the same beautiful
enrichment in the way of enamel-work and precious
stones as was bestowed on other personal ornaments
of the time, were made <i>&agrave; jour</i> to emit the sound of the
ticking and striking, and the lid was pierced with an
aperture over each hour, through which the position
of the hand might be seen.</p>

<p>The makers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span>endeavoured to vary as much as possible both the
figure of the machine and the material in which it was
placed. Not only square, oval, octagonal, and cruciform
watches occur, but some in such fanciful shapes as
death's-heads, books, shells, acorns, tulips, pears, etc;
while rock crystal (to render the works visible) and
other stones were often converted into cases. Oval
watches, known as "Nuremberg eggs", are usually
reckoned among the earliest, but this title was not given
to watches till some time after their invention, and
as a matter of fact, according to Dr. R&eacute;e (<i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>,
p. 172), all egg-watches that have been preserved belong
to the seventeenth century. In Hollar's set of plates
of the Four Seasons, dated 1641, the lady representing
Summer has on her left side depending from her girdle
an object of this shape, apparently a watch.</p>

<p>The most important pendent ornament to the girdle,
from the present point of view, is the pomander, the
early history of which has already been alluded to.
Throughout the sixteenth, and until about the middle
of the century following, the pomander formed an
almost invariable adjunct to the girdle, and was
occasionally, in the case of men, hung to the long and
heavy chains worn at that period round the neck.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Most of the pendants still termed pomanders were,
as has been already noted, in reality cases for scents or
different cosmetics; but from their fruit-like shape,
though often innocent of the original pomander ball,
they have retained the title, but solely, it would seem,
in our own language<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> (Pl. XXXI, 7).</p>

<p class="center"><b>SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY JEWELLERY (GENERAL)</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HROUGH the whole jewellery of the late Renaissance
there runs a gradual and profound change
of taste. Slowly and by imperceptible stages
the earlier style, with its minute enamelled figures
in high relief, gives place to a desire for sparkling
diamonds, and a pleasure in the glitter of faceted stones.
In the sixteenth century, diamonds, rubies, and other
stones played a comparatively insignificant part in
jewellery, and were prized mainly for their decorative
value, but during the course of the seventeenth century
a more prominent r&ocirc;le was gradually conceded to precious
stones. Used singly at first, in table-cut form, to give
a centre of interest or a note of colour, they came finally
to be arranged in juxtaposition and long rows. A complete
change was brought about in the whole character
of jewellery by the prominence thus given to the precious
stone&mdash;a position it has retained ever since.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the seventeenth century
Germany began to lose the position which, during the
greater part of the century previous, she had occupied as
a jewel-producing centre; while the Thirty Years' War,
by handicapping her industries, caused the jewellers to
seek employment elsewhere. It was mainly from France
that the new ideas in the form of ornaments emanated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_277" id="page_277">{277}</a></span></p><p>The French are fortunate in possessing separate
words to distinguish different kinds of jewellery:
<i>bijouterie</i>, a general term applied to all jewellery
formed of gold, enamels, and precious stones; and
<i>joaillerie</i>, used for jewellery composed of stones along
with a minimum of metal-work. By the revolution of
taste in the later days of the Renaissance the <i>joaillier</i>
gradually superseded the <i>bijoutier</i>; while the two crafts
of the silversmith and the jeweller replaced the ancient
craft of the goldsmith.</p>

<p>Changes in the mode of wearing clothes, and in the
materials employed for them, had an enormous influence
on jewellery. In place of the velvet and brocade that
prevailed during the Renaissance, damask came to be
worn, together with an extravagant taste for lace and
ribbons. The wearing of the silken stuffs that began
to be issued from the factories of Lyons, and of the
lace that formed their accompaniment, necessitated the
use of ornaments more in keeping with these materials;
with the result that the jewellery of the period assumed
an open and lace-like character, suitable also for the
display of precious stones.</p>

<p>At first coloured stones were used&mdash;the ruby, sapphire,
and the emerald; but soon the diamond held
sole possession of the field. In Renaissance ornaments
this latter gem played only a secondary part, and was
employed solely for the sake of contrast, but it now
appeared as the chief object in view, and formed the
ornament by itself, all other parts of the jewel, the
setting, and possible addition of other stones, being
wholly subordinate to it.</p>

<p>For the first general employment of the diamond in
jewellery one must look back to the fifteenth century, to
the invention of the art of cutting that stone, which is
generally credited, in spite of Laborde's opinion to the
contrary, to Louis de Berghem of Bruges in the year
1475. From that date until the beginning of the seventeenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_278" id="page_278">{278}</a></span>century every diamond, as is seen both by jewels
and their designs, was one of two forms: either the
"point," a four-sided pyramid produced by polishing the
faces of the native octahedral crystal of diamond and
making them exactly true and regular; or the "table," in
which the point of the crystal is reduced to a square or
oblong plane, the opposite extremity being also in plane
form, but of smaller extent, with sloping faceted edges.
This simple cutting did so little to augment the brilliance
of the diamond that the jewellers of the sixteenth
century had to depend on the <i>tinctura</i> or foiling of the
stone, in which art Cellini in his treatise, with his
characteristic appreciation of his own merits, tells us
that he particularly excelled.</p>

<p>The change of taste in the seventeenth century may
be attributed to the opening up of the diamond fields of
Golconda on the southern borders of the State of
Hyderabad, at the beginning of that century, and to the
enterprise of the French travellers, Tavernier, Chardin,
and others, who, during their frequent voyages to
Persia and India, dealt largely in precious stones. These
travellers succeeded in establishing new commercial relations,
which led to the introduction into Europe of abundance
of precious stones and particularly diamonds; while
the narratives of their journeys, furnishing more exact
knowledge of the quality and value of the products of the
East, attracted towards precious stones a new interest.</p>

<p>Owing to the abundance of material imported from
the East, the market for precious stones assumed an
entirely different aspect; while the quantity and beauty
of the material thus at their disposal spurred on the
stone-cutters towards the improvement of their technique,
until at the end of the century they arrived at
the true cutting of the diamond. Besides the "point,"
which was but rarely used, the table-cut diamond alone
was employed until the commencement of the seventeenth
century. About that time there came into use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_279" id="page_279">{279}</a></span>the "rose," a half-crystal, flat at the base and with a
convex top covered with a number of small facets.
Stones faceted in this manner were at first mostly small
and unimportant and cut very irregularly into four or
six facets.</p>

<p>Between the years 1641 and 1643, Cardinal
Mazarin, a great lover of the diamond, is said to have
encouraged the promotion of experiments by the Dutch
lapidaries which led to the true "rose" cutting. Anyhow,
a more systematic method of faceting in sixteen
facets&mdash;the <i>taille en seize</i>&mdash;began to be employed about
that time. This process, though it left much to be
desired, was an immense improvement, and set forth
the qualities of the stone in a way that had not been
possible by the forms previously in use. "Roses,"
together with "tables," as the designs of Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute;
and his contemporaries show, lasted until the invention
of the "brilliant" at the commencement of the
eighteenth century by the Venetian, Vincenzo Peruzzi,
though rose cutting was popular for some time after,
and is still used for certain stones.</p>

<p>The "rose" leaped into fashion at its first appearance,
and the taste for diamonds and other precious
stones seems to have dominated under Louis XIII
and Louis XIV, when they became the principal objects
in jewellery. Gold was worked into the form of garlands,
flowers, and all sorts of designs for the purpose
of mounting precious stones and setting off their
beauty. The enormous increase of luxury in this
direction was entirely in keeping with the whole
conception of an absolute monarchy as developed by
Louis XIV, who made it the duty of the grandees of
France and Spain to wear their whole property, in the
form of glittering gems, and to carry the value of lands
and forests upon their own and their wives' apparel
when they appeared before the eyes of their sovereign.</p>

<p>Though actual examples of the seventeenth-century
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_280" id="page_280">{280}</a></span>jewellery are rare, at any rate in public collections, we
can become acquainted with its characteristics by the
numerous prints bequeathed by the goldsmiths and
draughtsmen of the time. These prints, like those of
the sixteenth century, were not invariably the work
of their designers, since it was no uncommon practice
for the master-goldsmith to have his designs multiplied
for use in his own workshop, and for general circulation,
by placing them in the hands of an engraver. As
a rule the nationalities of existing jewels may be in
some measure determined by means of the designs
from which they were executed. But it is often difficult
to make clear distinctions in this manner, owing to the
continual artistic interchange which brought the fashions
of one place to another, and caused the methods and
ideas of the craftsmen to become common property.
The bi-lingual inscriptions which one finds on the
frontispieces of many of the pattern-books or sets of
designs then published, prove that they were intended
for international use.</p>

<p>The first attempts to base the composition of the
ornament exclusively upon the effect of stones arranged
in definite forms, without granting the setting of the
plastic metal any independent part, are found in some
of the prints of Daniel Mignot, of the year 1590.
Mignot, probably of French extraction, was a goldsmith
of Augsburg, where between the years 1590 and 1616
he produced a number of highly important designs for
jewellery, which form a link between the old and the
newer styles. While following the artists of the late
sixteenth century in the representation of figure
designs in cartouche-shaped ornaments formed of flat
strapwork curves characteristic of the older school,
he presents engravings of pendants, earrings, and
aigrettes, in which the stones are set in juxtaposition.</p>

</div>

<p>That the transition to the newer forms was slow, is
shown in the works of the goldsmith-engraver of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_281" id="page_281">{281}</a></span>Amsterdam, whose models for pendants, signed with
the initials P. R. K., and dated 1609 and 1617, are formed
of elaborate open scrollwork of tendril design, almost
destitute of stones. Exhibiting features more in keeping
with those of Mignot are the designs of Paul
Birckenhultz of Frankfort-on-the-Main (1617). They
are of fine quality, and take the form of aigrettes and
earrings set with precious stones and elaborate oval
pendants terminating with pearls and ornamented with
scroll ornaments intended for execution in enamel
(Pl. XL, 4). Birckenhultz is the last of the German
school of designers to model his work on the productions
of the sixteenth-century masters.</p>

<p>Henceforth one must look for designs chiefly to
France, where an entirely new type of ornament for
jewellery, such as is found in no other art production of
the time, was brought into existence by endeavours to
associate leaf patterns with a number of stones. Its
characteristic is the use of a sort of pea-pod or husk
ornament, termed <i>Schotenornamentik</i> in German, and
known generally by the French name of <i>genre cosse de
pois</i> (pea-pod style). In the designs of the time this
formal ornament is largely employed for elaborate
aigrettes; but owing to the jewels executed from such
designs having been set with stones, the result has
been that change of fashion has suffered scarcely a
jewelled example to survive. As a consequence, the
objects existing at the present day chiefly represent
enamelled miniature-cases and pendants. The number
and variety of engraved designs for this kind of ornament
in the form of jewelled bouquets or palmettes,
chiefly for aigrettes, dating from the first half of the
seventeenth century is surprising, considering that it
remained a comparatively short time in use. One of the
chief advocates of this style is Pierre Marchant, who
worked in Paris about 1623. His rare designs for
aigrettes, and wreaths for the borders of pendants, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_282" id="page_282">{282}</a></span>most graceful, and show a form of leaf ornament which
is extremely happily adapted for materials in which the
precious stone had to play a prominent part (p. 306).
Another Frenchman who employed it is Pierre Labarre
(1630), goldsmith to Louis XIV, who, together with a
well-known jeweller, Julien Defontaine, had apartments
in the Louvre. Amongst other French designers were
Jacques Caillard (1627), Baltasar Lemersier (1626-1630),
Claude Rivard (1592-1650), Fran&ccedil;ois Lefebure (1635-1661),
and G&eacute;d&eacute;on L&eacute;gar&eacute; (1615-1676), to whom as
"orf&eacute;vre-esmailleur," together with Pierre Bain,
Louis XIV in 1671, on the suggestion of Colbert,
granted quarters in the Louvre. Designs of the same
nature were executed in Strasburg by P. Symony (1621)
and Hans Mosbach (1626), and in Holland by Jacques
Honervogt (1625). The foregrounds or bases of nearly all
these engravings are remarkable for the landscapes and
for the quaint and vigorous genre figures in the style of
the painter-engraver, Jacques Callot, that enliven them.</p>

<p>Of all the goldsmiths of the time the best known
is Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute; of Chaumont-en-Bassigny, who was
jeweller to Louis XIV, and worked in Paris about
1663. His series of designs, entitled <i>Livre des
Ouvrages d'Orf&eacute;vrerie</i>, is perhaps the most interesting
of the kind produced during the seventeenth century.
These fine compositions, when formed of precious
stones, show knots and interlacings for clasps, pendants,
and earrings, in which diamonds are fully displayed
in rose-cut forms. As models for objects not composed
entirely of stones, we find seals, rings, bracelets
and chains decorated with ribbons and bows mingled
with monograms, and emblems, such as death's-heads.
Together with these appear tasteful arrangements for
enamel-work in the form of natural flowers of great
charm and delicacy. To these last reference will be
made later. Contemporary with L&eacute;gar&eacute; was the
painter and engraver Balthazar Moncornet, who worked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_283" id="page_283">{283}</a></span>at Rouen and Paris. His book of designs, of which
he was probably the inventor as well as engraver, entitled
<i>Livre nouveau de toutes sortes d'ouvrages d'orf&eacute;vries,</i>
was published about 1670<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. The jewels, in the
form of pendants, earrings, and brooches, are composed
of stones set in various ways; the last plate is a miniature
portrait of Louis XIV set as a brooch. All his designs
are accompanied by garlands of natural flowers.</p>

<p>Complete as was the change which was brought
about owing to the prominence given to the precious
stone, it must not be supposed that the enameller's art
was by any means neglected. Though it cannot be compared
with that in the best productions of the Renaissance,
the enamel-work applied to seventeenth-century
jewellery is, nevertheless, worthy of close attention.</p>

<p>Enamel executed by the champlev&eacute; method was
much employed. The technical process known as
champlev&eacute; was performed in two ways. By one method
the surface of the gold was simply incised with designs,
and the grooves thus made filled with enamel. By
another method only thin lines of the metal were
reserved to form the design, and the remainder of the
field cut out to receive the enamel. This latter system
resembles in appearance the well-known cloisonn&eacute;; but
the metal strips that form the partitions between the
enamel, instead of being inserted, are a solid part
of the metal base. Commonly employed on jewellery
from the middle of the sixteenth century, it remained
in general favour, together with the simpler form of
champlev&eacute;, till about the third decade of the seventeenth
century, when it gave place to enamel-work of an entirely
different kind.</p>

<p>For jewellery intended to be carried out by this
champlev&eacute; method, or on rare occasions to be covered
with translucent enamels, we have at our service again a
number of dated designs. These engravings, known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_284" id="page_284">{284}</a></span>as <i>Schwarzornamente</i> or niello ornaments, are in the
nature of silhouettes. The patterns, reserved in white
upon a black ground, are composed of curves of flat and
broken strapwork. The designs are occasionally for
complete jewels, but most of them take the form of very
small motives intended as patterns for the shoulders of
finger rings, or for the borders, frames, or other details
of jewels. Some engraved plates are made up entirely
of such motives; on other plates they appear as details,
either within a complete design or upon the field outside
it. Germany and the Netherlands furnish the earliest
examples of these. Several dating from the latter part
of the sixteenth century are by "monogrammists," who
signed their engravings with their initials, and whose
names are mostly unknown&mdash;such as the German master
A. C. of the year 1598. Among recognised engravers
in this style are the following:&mdash;Of the German school:
Arnold J&ouml;rg (1586-1596), Corvinianus Saur (1590-1597),
the rare Hans Hensel of Sagan (1599), Daniel Hailler
(1604), Jonas Bentzen (1615), and Daniel Mignot (1590)
and P. Symony (1621), both of whom placed these
motives on the field of their plates. Of the Netherlandish
school is the well-known Michel Le Blon, called
Blondus, goldsmith at the Court of Queen Christina
of Sweden, who was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main
in 1587 and died at Amsterdam in 1656. His designs
in silhouette, the earliest of which, in the British
Museum, is dated 1605,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> were in great demand, and
appear not only on knife-handles, but on oval and
octagonal box-shaped pendants&mdash;presumably watch-cases.
Also of the same school are: the rare master,
Hans van Ghemert (1585), Hans de Bull (1590), the monogrammist
P. R. K. (1609), and Guillaume de la Quewellerie
of Amsterdam (1611-1635). In addition there is
Giovanni Battista Costantini of Rome, who published
his <i>Ornementi per lavorare Giorje</i> in 1622 and 1625.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_285" id="page_285">{285}</a></span></p><p>The French goldsmith-engravers, who produced
designs in the "silhouette" manner intended for jewels
that were to be enamelled by the champlev&eacute; method,
include Jehan Vovert (1602), an anonymous engraver
A. D. (1608), Jacques Hurtu (1614-1619), Stephanus
Carteron of Ch&acirc;tillon (1615), Pierre Nolin (1620), and
Jean Toutin (1619) and his son Henri (1628).</p>

<p>The most important of these is the goldsmith and
enameller Jean Toutin of Ch&acirc;teaudun, whose plates&mdash;six
in number, dated 1618 and 1619&mdash;are filled with
charming motives for watch-cases or lockets, to be
carried out in enamel. They are ornamented with
patterns reserved in white on black ground in the form
of trailing leaves and tendrils, partly in the "pea-pod"
style, and accompanied by lively genre figures in various
attitudes. Perhaps the most attractive of these plates
is that which represents a jeweller&mdash;probably Toutin
himself&mdash;firing a jewel which he holds in the furnace
by a pair of long tongs, while above is figured a model
of the actual jewel&mdash;an octagonal box-like pendant
(p. 289).</p>

<p>Toutin, who appears to have been an experimenter
in enamels, is entitled to distinction as the discoverer
of a new process of using them. The process consisted
in covering a plate of gold or copper with an opaque
monochromatic enamel, on which designs were painted
with colours, opaque and fusible, and of greater variety
than had previously been employed. This method
of enamel painting, extensively used for jewellery,
proved to be peculiarly suitable to the representation
of natural flowers which came into high favour about
the same time.</p>

<p>The employment of naturalistic flower designs, as
displayed on the margins of manuscripts, was one of
the features of late Gothic art. The same tendency
with regard to flowers was manifested on the enamelled
jewellery of the fifteenth century, the most striking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_286" id="page_286">{286}</a></span>example of which is the wonderful necklace seen on the
Flemish portrait of Maria Baroncelli in the Uffizi
Gallery. Renaissance ornaments on the whole did not
favour naturalistic floral patterns, though flowers enamelled
in full relief are occasionally found, as on the
border of the Ph&oelig;nix Jewel in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The general return in the early part of the seventeenth
century to flower designs for the decoration of
jewellery is associated with a curious phase in the social
history of the time that accompanied the deep interest
then taken in flowers and horticulture. Among flowers,
of which the Dutch have ever been enthusiastically
fond, and never tired of growing and of painting, the
most prominent position was occupied by the tulip.
From about the year 1634 the cultivation of the tulip
became a perfect craze in Holland, and "Tulipomania"
like a violent epidemic seized upon all classes of the
community. Gambling of an almost unparalleled nature
was carried on in the bulbs, and the flower became
fashionable everywhere. In the bouquets which the
enamellers arranged with great taste, and painted with
extraordinary skill, the tulip is always prominent.</p>

<p>This and many other flowers, and occasionally fruits,
were painted in the same manner as a picture, on an
enamel ground of uniform colour&mdash;generally white, and
sometimes pale blue, yellow, or black. Small plaques
enamelled and painted thus are popularly known by the
name of "Louis Treize" enamels, though the majority of
them were produced after Louis XIII's death in 1643.</p>

<p>About 1640 it became the custom occasionally to
model the design in relief with a paste of white enamel,
which was afterwards painted with vitreous colours
according to nature. Towards the middle of the century
the background of the flowers was pierced and cut
away, so that every single flower, exquisitely modelled
and coloured, stood out by itself. In addition to tulips
of every variety, and hyacinths, sunflowers, and roses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_287" id="page_287">{287}</a></span>all kinds of lilies were in favour, especially the tiger-lily,
the "crown imperial," and different species of fritillaries,
whose beautifully spotted or chequered blossoms
were rendered in their natural colours with striking
fidelity. Flowers executed in this realistic style for
jewellery were arranged chiefly in garlands and festoons,
in the manner of the wreaths painted by Jan Brueghel
round several of Rubens' pictures, the flower pieces of
such Dutch and Flemish painters as Jan de Heem,
Van den Hecke, Daniel Seghers, and Van Thielen, and
the wood carvings of Grinling Gibbons (himself Dutch
by birth), which display the same remarkable realism.</p>

<p>Among the goldsmiths and draughtsmen of the
time who have left designs for jewels in painted enamel
are the Germans Heinrich Raab and Johann Paulus
Hauer, both goldsmiths of Nuremberg. Their engravings,
with natural flower ornamentation very finely
designed and executed, were published about 1650.
They comprise crosses, &eacute;tuis, scissor, watch, and scent
cases, and pendants&mdash;star-&nbsp;and bow-shaped, and set
each with a pendent pearl. Work in the same direction
by the artists of the French school is of great importance.
G&eacute;d&eacute;on L&eacute;gar&eacute;, though he practised the pea-pod
style, is the first to show a decided preference for
natural flowers in his engravings, which date from
about 1640. He is followed by three famous masters of
flower ornament&mdash;Balthazar Moncornet, Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute;,
and Jean Vauquer. Vauquer worked at Blois between
1670 and 1700, and like many other engravers of
jewellers' designs, was a jeweller and enamel painter
by profession. He was a pupil of Morli&egrave;re of Orleans,
who also worked at Blois. His fine plates of flowers
and ornamental foliage, engraved after his own designs
and entitled <i>Livre de fleurs propres pour orf&eacute;vres et
graveurs</i>, were published in 1680.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Vauquer was an
enamel painter of pre-eminent ability, and one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span>greatest exponents of the day of the art of representing
natural flowers.</p>

<p>Of the designs of Moncornet (<i>c.</i> 1670) and Gilles
L&eacute;gar&eacute; (<i>c.</i> 1663) for jewelled ornaments we have already
spoken. Moncornet, a great lover of flowers, accompanied
his jewels by charming garlands. With him
and Vauquer and L&eacute;gar&eacute; must be associated the
renowned enamel painter Jean Petitot (1607-1691), who
was first an enameller of jewellery. So highly skilled
was he as a painter of flower designs and foliage on
rings and other ornaments, that on going over to England
in 1635 he entered at once into the service of
Charles I, where he brought to perfection his famous
enamelled portraits.</p>

<p>Several actual examples have survived of the
enamel-work of Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute;, whose designs&mdash;the
best-known of this time&mdash;reveal a charming feeling for
natural flower ornaments. His <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> is generally
considered to be the garland of flowers painted in
enamel in open-work relief that surrounds a miniature
by Petitot of the Countess d'Olonne in the collection
of Major Holford at Dorchester House. This splendid
piece, on which the tints of the flowers are rendered
with striking fidelity, was formerly in the collection of
a great French connoisseur of the eighteenth century,
P. J. Mariette. At his death it passed into the possession
of Horace Walpole, who counted it as one of
his special treasures. It joined the Dorchester House
collection after the Strawberry Hill sale in 1842. If
this magnificent enamel-work be by the hand of
L&eacute;gar&eacute;, and we may take Mariette's word for it that it
is,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> this clever craftsman must have worked for Petitot;
for another very fine example of the same kind of
work, a wreath of enamelled flowers finely modelled
and painted, surrounds a miniature by Petitot in the
possession of the Earl of Dartrey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_289" id="page_289">{289}</a></span></p><p>To sum up the characteristic styles of seventeenth-century
ornament which we have endeavoured to
describe, the first feature is the general preference for
precious stones, and especially diamonds, and the use
of the "pea-pod" ornament for displaying them. From
this style, practised by Marchant and many others, we
pass, secondly, to the "Schwarzornamente" or "silhouette"
designs of Le Blon and Toutin employed for
champlev&eacute; enamel. Thirdly comes the development of
naturalistic flower designs, and the application of these
to the painted "Louis Treize" enamel evolved by
Toutin, and perfected by Petitot, Vauquer, and L&eacute;gar&eacute;.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="center"><b>SEVENTEENTH CENTURY JEWELLERY</b> (<i>continued</i>)<br />
<b>ENGLAND, SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE jewels of the seventeenth century, as has been
observed, are comparatively rare in public collections.
Unlike those of the Cinquecento,
which find a more appropriate place in the museum or
collector's cabinet, they are admirably adapted for
personal use at the present day; but until the change
of taste of the last few years in favour of old work,
these attractive objects, owing to their being set with
precious stones of intrinsic value, suffered cruelly at
the hands of modern jewellers in the destructive process
of resetting. Partly for this reason it is less easy than
it was with the jewellery of the century previous to
notify extant examples of all species of ornaments.
Their main features, already described, lie in a preference
for precious stones, and for a style of ornament
which, at first formal, evolves into naturalistic flower
designs in painted enamel.</p>

<p>Widespread luxury accompanied the large importation
of precious stones. Ladies made each new f&ecirc;te
a pretext for greater extravagance and greater efforts to
outshine their neighbours; and the ornament in which
they seem above all to have delighted for the best
display of their wealth of jewellery was the aigrette.
This ornament, of which some mention has been made
(p. 281), generally took the form of a bouquet of flowers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_291" id="page_291">{291}</a></span>on movable stalks, composed of clusters of precious
stones in enamelled gold, accompanied sometimes by a
jewelled knot, and was fixed in the hair on all occasions
of ceremony. A large number of these bouquets are
mentioned in the inventory of the French crown jewels
of 1618. In default of actual examples we must rely
on the designs which the jewellers of the day published
for them, and also on contemporary portraits, which
further illustrate a passing mode for plaiting strings of
pearls through the hair.</p>

<span class="caption">seventeenth-century enamelled pendants</span>
</div>

</div>

<p>Of earrings, on the other hand, a considerable number
of examples have survived. French and English portraits
show at first only a large pear-shaped pearl in each
ear. In the second half of the century more elaborate
earrings came into use. Spain, where these ornaments
have always been popular, produced at the time a
number of portraits exhibiting earrings of open-work
set with coloured stones. They are in the form of a
rosette or bow-shaped ornament hung with movable
pendants. The engravings of Rivard (1646), Lefebure
(1647), and Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute; (1663) include designs for earrings;
those of the last-named being such voluminous
jewels, hung with triple <i>briolettes</i>, <i>pendeloques</i>, or pearls,
that they might easily be mistaken for neck pendants.
The majority of earrings of this period, now existing,
are of Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian origin. The
general type of earring then in use is well shown in
Rembrandt's portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels (about
1652), in the Louvre, where it takes the form of
an elaborate pendant terminating with a big pearl
drop.</p>

<p>Necklaces of light open-work design are set with
diamonds or coloured stones. These seldom have a
special pendant; they were, in fact, fast disappearing to
make room for rows of pearls. Jewelled pendants, often
consisting of two or more mobile parts, were frequently
attached to a velvet band that closely encircled the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_292" id="page_292">{292}</a></span>throat. More important pendants of this period are
those which take the forms of mounted engraved gems
or enamelled portraits, or else of miniature cases or
lockets beautifully enamelled.</p>

<p>The finest series of mounted gems is that in the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris. Some of the mounts
are executed in the "pea pod" style in open-work;
others are ornamented with champlev&eacute; enamel, after the
niello designs in the silhouette manner; others again
are of natural flower designs in painted enamel.
There is a noteworthy example at Paris of the pea-pod
style&mdash;a cameo (No. 791) of Louis XIII as an infant.
It is in an open-work frame of opaque enamel&mdash;black,
dark green, and white&mdash;of about 1605, which bears a
very close resemblance to one of the published designs
of Pierre Marchant. In the Gem Room of the British
Museum is a still finer example, and one of the most
splendid jewels from the famous Marlborough Collection.
It is of open-work, enamelled white and green:
the husks or pods, set each with a small diamond, are in
green, and the little pea ornaments issuing therefrom are
in white enamel (Pl. XLIV, 17). The work dates from
the first years of the seventeenth century. The gem it
serves to enrich, a fine onyx cameo of Lucius Verus, is
slightly earlier. The choicest example of painted enamel
of flower design in open relief is certainly the mounting
or frame of a magnificent pendant (No. 961) in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale, set with a cameo of Lucrezia de'
Medici, wife of Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara. This
frame, quite unmatched for its taste and skill, is formed
of a garland of flowers, open-worked, and enamelled
in the utmost delicacy with white, pale yellow, and
light green enamel, heightened with reddish touches
(Pl. XLIII, 6). Among other jewels of the same style,
of which there are quite a number, one may mention the
setting of an antique Roman cameo (Pl. XLIV, 15),
and the reverse of the onyx "George" of Charles II
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_293" id="page_293">{293}</a></span>(Pl. XXVIII, 1) both English work, at Windsor
Castle<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. Besides the two beautiful examples of his work
already noticed (p. 288), it is usual to associate with
Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute; the frame of birds and flowers, enamelled
black and white, that surrounds Petitot's portrait of
Louis XIV in the Jones Collection at South Kensington.
The designs of Vauquer, also, seem to have been followed
in many similar kinds of enamelled jewels.</p>

<span class="caption">seventeenth century enamelled miniature cases,<br />

</div>

</div>

<p>The pendent miniature-cases or lockets of the seventeenth
century are of great interest. The best example
of those enriched with champlev&eacute; enamel is the Lyte
Jewel (p. 303). The "pea-pod" style is well shown on the
back of a miniature-case containing a female portrait by
Peter Oliver (1601-1647) in the Dyce Collection at South
Kensington (Pl. XLIII, 2). It is enamelled <i>en plein</i> with
translucent green on a ground of matted gold, with the
pea-pod pattern in white, after an engraved design by
the French ornamentist Pierre Firens (1605-1625). This
same style of ornament is seen on a miniature-case <i>&eacute;maill&eacute;
en r&eacute;sille sur verre</i><a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> belonging to Mr. Pierpont Morgan.
Enamel-work after the silhouette engravings of the same
period is represented by one of its principal exponents,
Jean Toutin of Ch&acirc;teaudun (1618), on the front and back
of a miniature-case (Plate XLIII, 1) in the possession
of Mr. Pierpont Morgan, ornamented with designs <i>en
genre cosse de pois</i> reserved in gold on a ground of black
enamel. Small plaques of "Louis Treize" enamel
painted in natural colours on a monochrome ground
were frequently employed for miniature-cases. A considerable
number of these, of both French and German
(Augsburg) work, exist. English work is rarer: an
example, upon the cover of a miniature of Oliver
Cromwell, painted with roses and leaves in natural
colours on a white ground, is preserved in the
University Galleries, Oxford. Enamelled flower designs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span>modelled in relief, sometimes on open-work
ground, in the manner of Vauquer and L&eacute;gar&eacute;, are
also found on lockets. An exquisite little example, inscribed
"O.C. 1653," belongs to Mr. Max Rosenheim.
It contains an enamelled miniature of Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>Like the aigrette, an important jewel worn at this
time was a breast ornament, termed a <i>S&eacute;vign&eacute;</i>, after the
celebrated lady of that name. This ornament took the
form of a bow or rosette of open-work, of foliated design,
generally of silver, set with small diamond splinters.
As the century advanced the work set with small stones
and diamond sparks in substantial mounts was replaced
by open-work jewels, known as "lazos" jewels, set
with large flat stones, and ornaments formed of several
pieces&mdash;an upper part of tied bow or knot shape and
hung with pendants&mdash;all set with rose-cut stones.
Much of this work, intended for the display of diamonds
and various coloured stones in imitation of flowers,
hails from Spain. It is admirably shown in Spanish
portraits&mdash;those, for example, by Velasquez, Coello, etc;
in the large series of Habsburg portraits preserved in
the castle of Sch&ouml;nbrunn, in Austria; and in portraits
of the Medici family by the painter Sustermans (1597-1681)
in the Uffizi and Pitti galleries. It is here worthy
of note that still in the seventeenth century we find
elaborate ornamentation applied to the back of jewels&mdash;a
notable feature in almost all jewellery of the finest
craftsmanship. A plain surface on this part of the
jewel was generally avoided by a charming use of the
graver, or by means of small panels of painted enamel.</p>

<p>Bracelets set with precious stones are generally of
open-work of the same style as the necklaces. Of those
executed in enamel there is a good French example at
South Kensington (Plate XXXVII, 2). It is formed of
six medallions, each containing a crowned cypher alternating
with true-lover's knots. It may usefully be
compared with Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute;'s designs for bracelets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span>and chains on Plate 8 of his <i>Livre des Ouvrages

</div>

<p>The finger rings of the early seventeenth century, as
far as one can judge from pictures, did not differ essentially
from the late sixteenth-century types; in fact many
of the ornamental rings usually ascribed to the sixteenth
century really date from the first half of the seventeenth.
The majority of small niello designs engraved at this
period were patterns for the shoulders of rings, intended
to be executed in enamel by the champlev&eacute; process
(Pl. XLI). Henri, son of Jean Toutin, furnishes a couple
of engravings for rings, of the year 1628, of which the
whole outer surface of the hoop is covered with designs
reserved in white on a black ground. De la Quewellerie
of Amsterdam, 1635, has also left the designs for a
finger ring in the same style. The love for "bouquets
d'orf&eacute;vrerie"&mdash;flower designs in coloured stones&mdash;finds
expression, towards the end of the century, in the <i>giardinetti</i>
ring, the bezel of which is formed like a nosegay,
a basket of flowers, or a bunch of flowers springing
from a vase. These floral designs are of charming
execution, and their coloured stones produce an extremely
pleasing effect. Many of these rings are
Italian, but there are several English examples at South
Kensington (Pl. XXXVI, 9, 10).</p>

<p>Painted enamels in flower patterns are found not
only on the shoulders of rings, but covering the entire
outer surface. Occasionally flowers enamelled <i>&agrave; jour</i>
occur, the hoop of the ring being hollow. Lord Falkland
possesses a good example of one of these rings encircled
with coloured flowers (Pl. XLIV, 8). The hollow
space is filled with hair. Within the hoop is the posy
<i>Difficulty sweetens enjoyment</i>. Mottoes or posies of
this kind were occasionally engraved on medi&aelig;val rings
and on those of the sixteenth century, but the majority
of the large number of rings on which such mottoes
occur belong to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span>Unlike the example just mentioned, these rings,
with the motto engraved inside them, usually have
plain hoops, and were used as engagement, and sometimes
as wedding rings. The mottoes generally rhyme,
but are not remarkable for poetic skill, and they are
found constantly repeated. Numbers of the verses
employed for the purpose are given in Jones's <i>Finger-Ring
Lore</i>, and in an article published by Sir John
Evans in <i>Longman's Magazine</i> (1892). A few examples
will suffice: <i>As God decreed so we agreed; God above
increase our love; This take for my sake; The love is
true I owe you; In thee my choice I do rejoice.</i> Posy
rings, like mourning rings, to be referred to later, are
almost exclusively English. As regards the ordinary
ornamental ring of the period, it is to be observed that
the diamond, which came so much to the front at this
time, found a prominent place on it. Towards the close
of the century, though enamel-work is still visible, the
purpose of the ring, as at the present day, seems to
have been nothing more than for displaying the diamond
on the finger, so far as one may judge from some
of L&eacute;gar&eacute;'s designs (Pl. XL, 2).</p>

<p>The girdle in the seventeenth century was still an
important ornament for ladies. The great portrait
painters of the Low Countries present ladies wearing
massive linked chains terminating in elaborate pomanders.
Not infrequently the lady is shown, as in a
picture by Gerard Douffet at Munich, holding the
pomander in her hand. A fine pomander is seen in
a portrait of a Flemish lady by Cornelis de Vos in the
Wallace Collection, and one of extraordinary beauty is
worn by a Dutch lady in a splendid picture by Frans
Hals in the Cassel Gallery. Amongst the various
seventeenth-century girdles to be found in public collections,
without doubt the most remarkable are two
examples, one in the Victoria and Albert Museum and
the other in the Wallace Collection. They represent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span>the species of enamel-work known as <i>&eacute;mail en r&eacute;sille
sur verre</i>, which was employed during the latter
part of the sixteenth and the early seventeenth
century for miniature and mirror cases&mdash;of which
specimens in the Morgan Collection and the Louvre
have already been noticed&mdash;and for the dials of watches.
The girdle at South Kensington, of French work of the
early seventeenth century, is formed of twenty-one
oblong and slightly convex plates linked together by
rosettes. These plates, of silver, are filled with glass
paste, which is backed with coloured foils and inlaid
with minute designs in translucent enamel on gold,
representing hunting and other country scenes. The
chain in the Wallace Collection, which might possibly
have been worn as a neck-chain, is almost identical in
subject and design, save that the oblong links number
eighteen, while the rosettes uniting them are enamelled
and set with garnets.</p>

<p>The jewel which best represents the various kinds of
decoration in the way of engraving and enamel-work
applied to seventeenth-century ornaments is the watch.
From the early part of the century the round form,
more or less flat, which has been preserved from that
time to the present day, began to be generally adopted
for watches. All the different species of work employed
on miniature-cases are found on watch dial-plates and
cases. The interesting <i>cosse de pois</i> ornament is
represented in the British Museum on the dial-plate of a
watch by D. Bouquet of London, of about 1630-1640.
It is executed by the rare process just described&mdash;the
pattern being inlaid on gold upon a ground of green
glass or enamel. Another watch, by Vautier of Blois,
has the centre of the dial enriched with translucent
enamel in gold cloisons on opaque white. Among
watches with richly decorated cases there is in the same
collection another by Bouquet, beautifully enamelled
with flowers in relief, of various colours and kinds, on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_298" id="page_298">{298}</a></span>black ground encrusted with small diamonds. Besides
the names already mentioned, the best-known enamellers
of watch-cases from about 1680 to 1700 were the
brothers Huault, or Huaud, of Geneva, who worked
also at Berlin.</p>

<p>No more examples need be given of the different
species of enamel applied to seventeenth-century jewellery.
Enough has been said to demonstrate the importance
and attractiveness of the comparatively little-known
enamel-work of this time.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the seventeenth century
the watch was simply hung by a chain to the girdle, as
we see it on the two portraits (about 1645) of the wife
of John Tradescant the younger in the Ashmolean
Museum, Oxford. The elaborate chatelaines which attached
the watch to women's girdles, and the chains
which hung from the fob-pocket of men, belong rather
to the eighteenth century; but they were already in
use, and from them were suspended that most attractive
article of jewellery, the seal, which was then beginning
to take the place of the signet ring. Evelyn, in his
<i>Mundus Muliebris</i>, or <i>Voyage to Marryland</i> (1690),
gives a rhyming catalogue of a lady's toilet, and
alludes to the chatelaine:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
To which a bunch of onyxes,<br />
And many a golden seal there dangles,<br />
Mysterious cyphers, and new fangles.</div></div></div>

<p>The designs of L&eacute;gar&eacute; contain several charming
pendent seals having their shanks or handles finely
worked with monograms and other patterns (Pl. XL).
Seals, however, together with the chatelaine and the
rest of its accompaniments, will be spoken of later.</p>

<p>There remain various pieces of jewellery, such
as buckles, clasps, or brooches, which were sprinkled
on different parts of the dress. Like the s&eacute;vign&eacute; or
breast ornament, they often take the form of a tied
bow, and find a place on the arms and shoulders, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_299" id="page_299">{299}</a></span>in rows down the front of the bodice and the skirt.
In the latter part of the century jewelled buckles replaced
the rosette of ribbons on the shoe. Thus again Evelyn
speaks of:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Diamond buckles too,<br />
For garters, and as rich for shoo<br />

A manteau girdle, ruby buckle,<br />
And brilliant diamond rings for knuckle.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">. . . . . . . . . .</span><br />
A saphire bodkin for the hair,<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>ENGLAND, SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</b></p>

<p>In England in the time of James I, the love of
personal ornament, among men as well as women, was
even more widespread than before. King James, and
also his Queen, who herself possessed a highly extravagant
taste for jewellery, set a public example by their
patronage of the jewellers; while the nobility outbid
one another in lavish expenditure. John Chamberlain,
an entertaining correspondent of the day, writes thus
in 1608 to a friend unable to attend a masque: "Whatsoever
the devise may be, and what success they may have
in their dancing, yet you should be sure to have seen
great riches in jewels, when one lady, and that under
a baroness, is said to be furnished for better than a
hundred thousand pounds; and the lady Arabella goes
beyond her, and the Queen must not come behind."</p>

<p>Contemporary chroniclers have left no descriptions
that show precisely how the King's own person reflected
the fashions in jewellery of his day, yet we know
that he possessed an almost childish admiration for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_300" id="page_300">{300}</a></span>"bravery," as it then was termed, particularly such as
was intended for the decoration of those about his
person. A very curious instance of the King's interest
in these matters is to be found in the elaborate instructions
he issued concerning the despatch of a large consignment
of jewels for the use of the Prince of Wales,
and his favourite, Buckingham, on their memorable
journey to Spain in 1623. In the spring of that year
orders were given to several officers of State, and with
them the jeweller Heriot, to repair to the Tower and
make a selection of the finest jewels there&mdash;some fit
for a woman, and others for the Prince to wear. Among
them a "jewel called the Three Brothers, five or six
faire jewels to be worn in men's hats, same to be of
&pound;6,000 or &pound;7,000 value, and none under; the five
pendent diamonds that were the Queen's, whether they
remain upon a string or be made up upon a feather. If
none of the Targett fashion for hats, the jewels to be
broke up to make them."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>To his son and favourite the King then addresses a
letter, in which he tells them that he had been choosing
"the jewells I am to send you, whereof my Babie is to
present some to his Mistresse, and some of the best hee
is to wear himselfe, and the next best hee will lend to
my bastard brat [Buckingham] to wear." On their
removal from the Tower the jewels are carefully inventoried,
and Heriot is set to work to refashion them.
After a fortnight's work he promises that they will be
finished in a few days. So, on the 18th of March, "the
jewels," we learn, "have been delivered." "Mr. Herriot
is gone to assist in packing them, and has sat
up day and night to get them completed."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The King then writes that he is sending for his
"Babie's owin wearing ... the Three Brethren,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> that

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span>of Frawnce, the fellowe of the Portugall Dyamont,
quhiche I wolde wishe you to weare alone in your hatte
with a litle blakke feather." To his "sweete Gosseppe"
he sends "a fair table dyamonde." "I have hung," he
says, "a faire peare pearle to it for wearing in thy hatte
or quhair thow pleasis."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>As the result of extensive transactions both with the
Crown and the nobility the jewellers of the day seem to
have reaped a rich harvest; and they attained to positions
of eminence by adding banking to their more
ancient art of working in the precious metals. Of the
royal jewellers, George Heriot of Edinburgh&mdash;rendered
immortal by Sir Walter Scott as "Jingling Geordie"&mdash;the
founder of Heriot's Hospital, comes first to mind.
Heriot received in 1597 a life appointment as jeweller
to Queen Anne of Denmark, and in 1601 James made
him his own jeweller. He followed the King to London,
and in 1603, together with William Herrick and John
Spilman, was appointed jeweller to the King, Queen,
and Prince, at a yearly salary of &pound;50. Immense sums
of money were paid him both as interest on loans and
for the jewels supplied to their Majesties, of which long
lists have been preserved. Sir John Spilman, a German
by birth and one of the chief jewellers of Queen
Elizabeth, executed great quantities of jewellery at the
royal commands; but Sir William Herrick seems to
have obtained an even larger share of the royal patronage.
Queen Anne of Denmark, who spent an enormous
amount on personal ornaments, received &pound;36,000 worth
from him alone. "Queen Anne," writes a contemporary
shortly after her death, "hath left a world of brave
jewels behind; and although one Piers, an outlandish
man, hath run away with many, she hath left all to the
Prince [Charles] and none to the Queen of Bohemia
[her daughter Elizabeth]." In fact, so many of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_302" id="page_302">{302}</a></span>jewels were embezzled that scarcely a vestige remained,
though Herrick produced the models of them and swore
to their delivery.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The poet Robert Herrick, Sir
William Herrick's nephew, was a jeweller-apprentice to
his uncle for several years, and his early training seems
to have left a strong impression on him, for his poems
throughout betray a love and appreciation for jewels.
Among other jewellers whose names occur in the State
Papers, the following may be mentioned: Philip Jacobson,
Arnold Lulls, John Acton, and John Williams&mdash;a
maker of gold neck-chains and pendent medals.</p>

<p>As far as the actual productions of the Jacobean
jewellers are concerned we meet with comparatively few
examples; this want, however, is supplied, to a certain
extent, by means of a beautiful set of contemporary
drawings for jewellery preserved in the Victoria and
Albert Museum&mdash;the work of Arnold Lulls, a jeweller
whose name occurs several times in the royal accounts.
In conjunction with Sir William Herrick, Lulls supplied
the King in 1605, as New Year's gifts for the
Royal Family, with jewels to the amount of &pound;3,000.
For a certain jewel of diamonds, with pearls pendent,
and two dozen buttons supplied by him and Jacobson,
and bestowed by His Majesty on the Queen at the
Princess Mary's christening the same year, Lulls was
paid &pound;1,550.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Lulls' designs, drawn in water-colours in a parchment
book, number altogether forty-one. The majority, set
with large table-cut stones and hung with huge pear-shaped
drops, are for pendent ornaments, for wearing
either on the neck-chain, or as earrings, or else
upon the hat. Among the drawings are two designs for
a "rope of round pearls, great and orient"&mdash;forty-seven
in number&mdash;given to the Queen, and several designs
for the above-mentioned diamond and pearl ornament
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_303" id="page_303">{303}</a></span>given her in 1605; two drawings for Georges of the
Order of the Garter given to Prince Henry; and designs
for a large balas ruby with pearl pendant mentioned in
an inventory of the Prince's jewels.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The remaining
drawings include four of jewelled aigrettes set with diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, and sapphires (Plate XXX, 1).
These remarkable contemporary illustrations of English
jewellery reveal the change then beginning to take place
in the character of personal ornaments. Yet, though
precious stones are much in evidence, in almost every
case their settings are coloured, while the design of each
jewel is completed with charming scrollwork enriched
with polychrome enamels.</p>

<p>The finest Jacobean jewel in existence is the famous
miniature-case known as the Lyte Jewel, now in the
Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum. Miniature-cases
of gold elaborately enamelled, with hinged fronts
often set with jewels, were as much in vogue as in
Elizabeth's time; and records show that many precious
"picture cases" of the kind were made for James I as
presents to personal friends or to ambassadors. The
cover of the Lyte Jewel is of open-work, filled with
the letter R, with diamonds on the outside and brilliant
enamel within. The back is a white enamelled plate
with a design in fine gold lines and ruby enamel, the
edge being enamelled alternately ruby colour and
sapphire-blue. Within is a portrait of James I ascribed
to Isaac Oliver. The first owner of the jewel was Mr.
Thomas Lyte. This gentleman drew up a long pedigree
of King James I's ancestry and presented it to the
King, who was so much pleased with it that he rewarded
Mr. Lyte with "his picture in gold, set with diamonds,
with gracious thanks." The jewel passed from the
Lyte family some generations ago into the hands of the
Duke of Hamilton. At the dispersal of the Hamilton
Palace collection it was bought for the sum of &pound;2,835 by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span>Baron Ferdinand Rothschild, who bequeathed it with his
other art treasures to the British Museum. A contemporary
portrait of Thomas Lyte, dated 1611, in the possession
of Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte shows him wearing
it suspended from a brown ribbon round his neck. The
jewel is the same, save that the drop at the bottom, now
a single pearl, was originally trilobed. This exquisite
jewel was probably the work of one of the court jewellers
mentioned above. The design on the back, which corresponds
in style with engravings of Daniel Mignot and
the other earlier designers in the "silhouette" manner,
exemplifies the influence exercised by the ornamentists
on all the jewellery of the period (Pl. XLI).</p>

<p>Throughout the reign of Charles I ornaments in the
same style as those portrayed in Lulls' drawings appear
to have remained in use. All jewellery was largely
influenced by the pattern-books issued from the
goldsmith-engravers' shops of Germany, France and
Flanders. Several jewellers themselves came over, as
did the well-known Michel Le Blon, in the early part
of the reign. In 1635 the famous goldsmith-enamellers
Petitot and Bordier likewise visited England, and
doubtless made their influence felt on the enamelled
jewellery of the time. The period, on the whole,
though it terminated disastrously for all the sumptuary
arts, seems to have been a prolific one in the production
of jewellery. The chief business was shared by the
court jewellers&mdash;James Heriot (half-brother of George
Heriot), Philip Jacobson, Thomas Simpson, John Acton,
and William Terrey. Though he showered commissions
on these jewellers, the King had commenced early
in his reign the dispersal of the immense hoards of
jewellery brought together by his predecessors; and by
selling and pawning raised large sums of money, to
make good the deficiencies caused by the rupture with
Parliament. Subsequently, during the Civil War, to
relieve his personal necessities, numbers of jewels were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_305" id="page_305">{305}</a></span>sold at home, and many more pawned and sent over to
the dealers at Amsterdam, who broke them up for the
intrinsic value of their gold and precious stones; while
the remainder were put under the hammer by a commission
appointed after the King's death to dispose of
the works of art in the royal collection.</p>

</div>

<p>The fact that all classes during the struggle parted
with their valuables to assist their respective champions
has rendered jewellery extremely rare. Women, and
even little children, voluntarily sent their necklaces and
brooches "for the King"; while Cromwell was assisted
in the same manner.</p>

<p>Great luxury in jewellery appears to have been
associated with the Court of Charles II. The King
himself bestowed magnificent presents on his mistresses.
Amongst his jewellers was "that prince of goldsmiths,"
Sir Robert Vyner, who made the crown jewels. Later
on King Charles had as court jeweller the celebrated
French traveller and gem merchant Sir John Chardin,
who settled in London with an immense collection of
precious stones acquired in the East. Another eminent
jeweller of the time was the banker Alderman Edward
Backwell, whose old books, still preserved, are full of
interesting accounts for jewels supplied during the
Commonwealth and the reign of Charles II. The
religious troubles which had led Chardin to quit France
induced a number of other French jewellers, after the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, to establish
themselves in England. These foreign jewellers, like
the army of craftsmen in every field that at all times
swarmed into England, soon accustomed themselves
to their environment and became as English as the
English themselves. English work has ever had its
own distinctive mark, for whatever the native craftsmen
themselves borrowed they speedily made their own.</p>

<p>The chief jeweller of the latter part of the century
was Sir Francis Child&mdash;one of the founders of the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_306" id="page_306">{306}</a></span>banking house that still bears his name. He was
appointed court jeweller to William III in 1689, and
supplied the King with a great quantity of jewellery.
Much of this was intended as presents to ambassadors;
for jewellery, it appears, played a very prominent
part in the diplomatic affairs of the day. Even the
most trifling negotiation cost the Exchequer an enormous
amount in presents of this kind, while foreign
envoys were likewise obliged to disburse large sums for
the same purpose. Lists of these gifts and of other
jewels are preserved in the ledgers of this ancient firm
of goldsmith-bankers, and have been published by Mr.
F. G. Hilton Price in <i>The Marygold by Temple Bar</i>. A
set of drawings for jewels of about the year 1674 from
Sir Francis Child's ledger, with particulars concerning
them in the great goldsmith's own handwriting, is here
reproduced (Pl. XLV).</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="center"><b>EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE jewellery that came into fashion towards the
close of the seventeenth century and flourished
during the greater part of the eighteenth follows
the style known as "rococo." Rococo ornament with
its assemblage of rich fantastic scrolls and crimped
conventional shellwork wrought into irregular and
indescribable forms, though overcharged and inorganic,
yet possesses certain beauty and artistic quality. Like
most objects in this style, rococo jewellery has a real
decorative charm. But the title of baroque or rococo
is really less adapted to jewellery than to other art productions
of the time, for jewellery itself never indulged
in the same extravagant use of this form of ornament.</p>

<p>Except for slight changes in design, eighteenth-century
jewellery, as far as its general form is concerned,
does not at first display any marked variation
from that of the previous century. A charming but
somewhat superficial sentimentality expressed by means
of pastoral subjects results in ornaments on which
tokens of friendship are represented in all manner of
forms. The naturalistic tendency in ornament is still
strong, but is less striking than it was before, since
feather, ribbon, and other conventional designs make
their appearance, mingled with flowers and leaves.
These rococo jewels, on account of the setting and
arrangement of the precious stones which entirely
govern their composition, are in their way masterpieces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_308" id="page_308">{308}</a></span>both technically and artistically. Unlike the earlier
jewels, one cannot help regarding them rather more
as accessories to costume than as independent works
of art.</p>

<p>The general character of the jewellery of the period
with which we are now dealing may best be judged by
a notable series of original designs in colour for such
objects executed by the Santini family of Florence,
and now preserved in the Library of the Victoria and
Albert Museum. This remarkable collection comprises
upwards of 382 separate designs, which are mostly
constructed in a manner best calculated to show off
the brilliant character and size of the stones and pearls,
on which their effect mainly depends. A large proportion
of the drawings take the form of what at this
period constituted a parure, or set of jewels, composed
of three items of similar design&mdash;a bow-shaped breast
ornament hung with a cross, and a pair of earrings
<i>en suite</i>. In place of the breast ornament is sometimes
a V-shaped corsage in imitation of hooks and eyes or
braidwork, set with various precious stones. The
whole work shows that in the eighteenth century the
stone cutter and stone setter had practically supplanted
the artist in precious metals. In the metal-work of
the settings&mdash;in most cases a matter of minor
consideration&mdash;gold is employed for coloured stones and
silver for diamonds.</p>

<p>The general tendency is towards the rococo, but
this type of ornament is here by no means strongly
marked. In other directions, however, it is more
apparent, and already in the seventeenth century we
meet with traces of it in engraved designs for jewellery.
The best work of this kind is that of Friedrich Jacob
Morisson, a draughtsman and jeweller who worked at
Vienna from about 1693 to 1697. He was one of
the most popular jewellers of the day, and his plates,
which are rich in motives for ornaments in precious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_309" id="page_309">{309}</a></span>stones and fine metal-work, found a wide circulation.
They comprise aigrettes, earrings, brooches, pendants,
bracelets, rings, &eacute;tuis, and seals. Other Germans who
have left designs in the same style are F. H. Bemmel
(1700) of Nuremberg, D. Baumann (1695), Johann
Heel (1637-1709), and J. F. Leopold (1700)&mdash;all of
Augsburg.</p>

<p>French designers led European taste in jewellery
as in furniture, and published a number of important
designs. The most remarkable are those of the master-goldsmith
Jean Bourguet of Paris, whose models for
earrings, pendants, and clasps, dated 1712 and 1723,
are set with large faceted stones, and have their backs
chased or enamelled with flower designs. His <i>Livre
de Taille d'&Eacute;pargne</i> with designs for enamel-work
published as models for jewellers' apprentices, contains
amongst other patterns a series of twelve rings set
with large faceted stones; beside each ring is a design
for the enamel decoration of its shoulder: "Petits
morceaux" he calls them, "de taille d'&eacute;pargne facile &agrave;
coppier." Contemporary with Bourguet was Pierre
Bourdon, of Coulommiers en Brie, who worked at
Paris. His designs, dated 1703, are for seals, scent
cases, and watch covers of rococo work, and pendent
medallions and miniature frames set with precious
stones. Among other Parisian designers are the
master-goldsmiths Briceau (1709), and Mondon (<i>c.</i>
1730-1760) whose <i>Livre de Pierreries, Pour la Parure
des Dames</i> contains patterns for earrings, brooches,
and aigrettes set with brilliants, and for enamelled and
jewelled watches. Of Italian designs for jewellery set
with precious stones in the rococo style we may note
those of G. B. Grondoni of Genoa, who worked at
Brussels about 1715, Carlo Ciampoli (1710), and
D. M. Albini, whose <i>Disegni moderni di gioiglieri</i> were
published in 1744.</p>

<p>The publication in London of several series of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_310" id="page_310">{310}</a></span>designs proves that England was not far behind the
Continent in the production of high-class personal ornaments.
Among the most important pattern-books for
jewellery, are those of Simon Gribelin, who was born in
Paris in 1662, and worked chiefly in London, where he
died in 1733. His work includes <i>A book of seuerall
Ornaments inuented and ingraued by S. Gribelin, 1682</i>,
and <i>A Book of Ornaments usefull to Jewellers</i>, etc.,
1697. These were republished in 1704. Gribelin's
productions were followed by those of J. B. Herbst,
who issued in 1708 <i>A book of severall ornaments fit
for Juweler, made by J. B. Herbst</i>, and in 1710 <i>A Book
of Severall Juwelers work, ... Sold by Mr. Eymaker,
Juweler in Earls Court drury lane London</i>. The
patterns are chiefly for seals, and for breast ornaments
and clasps set with rose-cut stones in rococo settings.
About the same time similar pattern-books were published
by J. Smith and Thomas Bowles. In 1736
appeared <i>A book of jeweller's work design'd by Thomas
Flach in London</i>, engraved by J. Fessey. It contains
designs for buckles, seals, watch-keys, a chatelaine
with a watch and another with an &eacute;tui, pendants and
bow-shaped breast ornaments hung with drop pearls.
In 1762 J. Guien published in London a <i>Livre de
jouailleries&mdash;A book of Ornaments for Jewellers</i>, containing
various designs in precious stones in the
manner of Morisson and Grondoni.</p>

<p>An isolated phenomenon in the midst of the universal
love for precious stones that then dominated the
productions of the jewellers, there stands out Johann
Melchior Dinglinger, who carried the traditions of the
sixteenth century far into the eighteenth. Born at
Biberach, near Ulm, in 1665, Dinglinger worked first
at Augsburg, and, having visited Italy, was summoned
to Dresden in 1702 by Augustus II, Elector of Saxony,
where he lived until his death in 1731. During these
thirty years, aided by his brother Georg Friedrich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_311" id="page_311">{311}</a></span>(d. 1720) and his son Johann Melchior (1702-1762), he
was employed as court jeweller to the Elector, whom
he assisted in planning and arranging the Gr&uuml;ne
Gew&ouml;lbe at Dresden, which marvellous assemblage
of precious objects contains the best examples of his
work. All the processes of the Cinquecento craftsmen,
of whose technique he possessed a fine knowledge, were
employed by Dinglinger with wonderful care and
exactitude&mdash;though his productions naturally betray in
design the period of their execution. He exercised
considerable influence on his contemporaries, more
especially with regard to the revival of the art of
enamelling in the second half of the century, when
jewellery made a notable advance in the time of
Louis XVI.</p>

<p>A change in style was first experienced on the arrival
in power of Madame de Pompadour, who led the way
in that coquettish return to simple conditions of life
which showed itself in the pastorals of the Louis
Quinze epoch. It resulted in a preference for simple
gold; this metal, coloured by alloys such as platinum
and silver, and popular under the name of <i>&agrave; quatre
couleurs</i>, being at most only set off by enamel painting.
This later rococo period, as far as its technique is concerned,
is one which has never been equalled either
before or since.</p>

<p>An event of importance in the history of jewellery,
as of art generally, was the discovery in 1755 of the
city of Pompeii, succeeding that in 1713 of Herculaneum,
buried for centuries beneath the ashes of
Vesuvius. The journeys of artists to Italy and to
Naples, and the interest aroused thereby in ancient art,
a weariness with the mannerism of rococo ornament,
and the whim of fashion, gradually transformed jewellery
like other decorative arts, and resulted in the
classicism of the style of Louis XVI. Antique forms
as they then were known showed themselves in a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_312" id="page_312">{312}</a></span>charming manner in well-balanced jewels, where different
coloured gold took the form of classical motives in
the midst of ribbons, garlands, and the pastoral subjects
dear to the previous epoch. Enamel returned into
fashion, and accomplished its chief triumph with painting
<i>en plein</i> in fine transparent tones over <i>guilloch&eacute;</i>
gold. In conjunction with the art of gem setting and
cutting, and metal chasing, this species of enamel
produced effects which were all the more surprising,
seeing that it was often confined to the smallest of
spaces.</p>

<p>Among the first craftsmen who created, or followed
the fashion, was the jeweller Lempereur. Some of his
designs were published by his pupil Pouget the younger
in 1762 and 1764, in a treatise entitled <i>Trait&eacute; des
pierres pr&eacute;cieuses et de la mani&egrave;re de les employer en
Parure</i>, the plates of which, mostly coloured, and representing
models of jewellery of all kinds set with precious
stones, were engraved by Mlle. Raimbau. Another
pupil of Lempereur, August Duflos, published in 1760
a similar work entitled <i>Recueil de Dessins de Joaillerie</i>.
Other French designers of jewellery at this time were:
Maria, a jeweller of Paris, who issued about 1765 an
important series of plates, thirty-five in number, of
pendants, brooches, clasps, chatelaines, aigrettes, seals,
rings, and buckles; P. Moreau (1740-1780) and J. B. Fay
(1780-1790), both of Paris; and L. Van den Cruycen
(1770) of Brussels.</p>

<p>In 1770 was published in London by T. D. Saint
<i>A new book of designs for jewellers' work</i> containing
eleven plates of ornaments of various kinds in the style
of Pouget and Duflos. One of the last English
jewellers of the old school was George Michael Moser
(1707-1783), one of the founders of the Academy&mdash;like
Fuseli, a Swiss by birth, and a native of Schaffhausen.
He was originally a gold chaser&mdash;"the first in the
kingdom," so Sir Joshua Reynolds described him; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_313" id="page_313">{313}</a></span>when that mode of decorating jewellery was put aside
in favour of enamels, he turned his attention to enamel
compositions of emblematical figures, much in vogue for
the costly watch-cases of the day, for chatelaines, necklaces,
bracelets, and other personal ornaments. He
succeeded so well in this class of work that the Queen
patronised him, and he executed a considerable number
of commissions for the King.</p>

<p>Another eminent jeweller, who was likewise a painter
and enameller, was Augustus Toussaint. He worked
principally with his father, a noted jeweller of Denmark
Street, Soho, and exhibited at the Royal Academy from
1775 to 1778, sending in both miniatures and enamels.
He died between 1790 and 1800. Several of the fine
open-work jewelled frames which held the choice miniatures
of the day, were made in the workshop of Toussaint
the elder, and on his death his son Augustus is said not
only to have retained for his own use all the examples
of these frames which were in stock, but to have
continued to supply a few fellow-artists, with whom
he was on terms of intimacy, with the celebrated
Toussaint frames.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The excess of ornamentation and the desire for
jewellery formed of precious stones had, since the
seventeenth century, favoured the use of imitations.
Rock crystal or quartz had long been employed to
imitate diamonds. Forgeries and imitations which
were intended to pass as precious stones will be
spoken of in another place. But at this time even
people of great wealth wore imitation jewels, such
as certainly would not be worn by persons in a
corresponding position nowadays. These made no profession
of being real stones. They were recognised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_314" id="page_314">{314}</a></span>as imitations. The credit of the production of the
first satisfactory substitute for the diamond is due to
a German&mdash;Stras or Strass by name&mdash;who about
1758 established himself at Paris on the Quai des
Orf&eacute;vres, where he met with great success as a vendor
of paste imitations of diamonds, which still bear his
name. Competitors were not slow in making their
appearance, and one Ch&eacute;ron also gave his name for
a considerable time to the false diamonds that issued
from his workshop. So large and flourishing did the
industry in imitations become that in 1767 a corporation
of <i>joailliers-faussetiers</i> was established in Paris.</p>

<p>Imitation pearls were likewise very largely worn;
even ladies of high position did not disdain to wear
them&mdash;"Un collier de perles fausses" occurs in the
inventory of the jewels of Madame de Chamillart
made on her death in 1731. False pearls first appeared
in Paris about the time of Henry IV, the production of
one named Jaquin, whose descendants carried on a
large business in them in Paris till the middle of the
eighteenth century. "So well have pearls been imitated,"
writes Pouget the younger, in 1762, "that most of those
of fine Orient have found their way back from Europe
to Asia, and are so rare in France that nowadays one
scarcely sees any good specimens."</p>

<p>Productions such as these were rendered necessary
to satisfy the luxury which from the nobility had
extended over the whole middle classes, and also on
account of the strained condition of French finance.
&Eacute;tienne de Silhouette, Controller of Finance, endeavoured
to cut down expenses, and issued in 1759 an
invitation to the wealthy to bring in their jewels to be
converted into cash for the benefit of the Treasury.
Such attempts at economy, though rewarded only by
ridicule, so that portraits henceforth executed in
the commonest manner were <i>&agrave; la Silhouette</i>, yet met
with this result, as Pouget observes, that since the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_315" id="page_315">{315}</a></span>time of M. de Silhouette marcasite had become very
much the fashion in France. In Switzerland, too, since
it was forbidden to wear diamonds, ladies, he tells us,
wore no other ornaments than marcasite, and spent a
good deal of care and money in the setting of it. The
mineral known as marcasite, a word which was spelled
in many ways, is a crystallised form of iron pyrites cut
in facets like rose diamonds, and highly polished. It
was used for a number of ornaments. Steel, likewise
cut in facets, was similarly employed.</p>

<p>Steel jewellery appears to have been invented in
England, and from Birmingham, the centre of its manufacture,
found its way all over Europe, reaching France
by way of Holland. It was carried out largely by
Boulton and Watt and other firms of Birmingham,
Sheffield, and Wolverhampton. This steel jewellery,
which was in high favour in the latter half of the
eighteenth, continued to be worn until the second
quarter of the nineteenth century, when it finally went
out of fashion. Even after that, cut steel was still made
at Birmingham, and the firm of Hipkins, one of the
most prominent, continued for many years to supply
the Court of Spain with buttons and buckles ornamented
with it (Pl. LI, 1, 2). Steel was largely employed
as mounts for the fictile cameos of Wedgwood, Tassie,
Adams, and Turner, which were in considerable demand
for rings, brooches and buttons. Mountings for these
were also made in silver or Sheffield plate, principally
the work of Thomas Law &amp; Co., of Sheffield. In the
latter part of the century England occupied a unique
position with regard to the production of objects of this
kind, which were eagerly sought for throughout the
whole of the Continent.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the changed condition of
the times was the use in jewellery, together with strass,
false pearls, and marcasite, of various substitutes for
gold. The best-known of these substitutes was "pinchbeck,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_316" id="page_316">{316}</a></span>so called after its inventor, Christopher Pinchbeck
(d. 1732), a clock and watch maker, of Fleet Street.
This pinchbeck gold was an alloy of copper and zinc.
When fused together the metals assumed the colour of
fine gold, and preserved for a time a bright and unoxidised
surface, though in some cases objects thus
fashioned received a washing of gold. Pinchbeck was
much used for cheaper jewellery of all kinds. The
larger articles made of this metal were chatelaines,
snuff-boxes, and &eacute;tuis, while watch-cases, miniature-frames,
buckles, clasps, and so forth, are to be found for
the most part ornamented in relief and carefully chased.
These several articles to which pinchbeck was suited,
went in those days by the name of "toys". The term
"Toyman" was employed by Pinchbeck himself, but
the title had, of course, no reference to what are now
known as toys. In France and Germany a metal composition
like gold, in imitation of pinchbeck, called
<i>Similor</i> or "goldshine," was produced, first by Renty,
of Lille, about 1729, and subsequently improved by
Leblanc, of Paris. But the name of the English inventor
of the metal was well known in France, where
it was retained in such forms as "pinsebeck" or
"pinsbeck."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The head-ornament&mdash;the aigrette&mdash;was still an
important jewel in the eighteenth century. Generally a
kind of delicately formed bouquet of precious stone in
very light setting, it continued long in fashion, together
with strings of pearls among the hair. For a while the
aigrette was set aside for bows, small birds, etc., made
of precious stones mounted upon vibrating spiral wires
which were then attached to the hair-pin. These went
under the name of "wasps" or "butterflies." In the
days of Marie Antoinette they were supplemented by
hair-pins and aigrettes set entirely with diamonds,
which about 1770 had almost entirely superseded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_317" id="page_317">{317}</a></span>coloured stones. Many designs for these head-ornaments
were published by Pouget the younger and
Duflos, the latter of whom complains in the preface to
his work of the tendency shown in his day to do away
with the admixture of coloured stones with diamonds;
a proof that up to this date, in spite of the general
preference for the diamond, taste had not yet learned to
do without colour effect in jewellery.</p>

</div>

<p>Earrings, as has been noticed in reference to the
Santini designs, were in particular favour at this period.
The majority were composed of large faceted stones or
of pearls, formed <i>girandole</i> fashion&mdash;that is to say, of a
large circular stone above, with three <i>briolettes</i> or pear-shaped
pendants below. A pair of earrings of this form,
said to have belonged to Madame du Barry, are in
possession of Lady Monckton. They are set each with
four sapphire pastes of very fine quality; the three
drop-pendants being separated from the upper stone by open
spray-work of silver set with white pastes (Pl. XLVI, 5, 6).
Similarly elaborate pendent earrings in seven sections
composed of brilliants are seen in an original mezzotint
portrait of Queen Charlotte by Thomas Frye (<i>c.</i> 1760).
Drop-shaped pendants, mostly diamonds, were then
very highly esteemed. Marie Antoinette had a pair
of diamond earrings with stones of this form hanging
from a perpendicular line of large brilliants. The
designs of Ciampoli, Mondon, Guien, Pouget, Van den
Cruycen, and Fay, all contain varieties of earrings,
mostly <i>girandole</i> fashion.</p>

<p>For necklaces the engravings of these same designers
supply many patterns. Like the <i>carcan</i> of the
fifteenth century, they are often in the form of a band
about an inch in width, composed of precious stones&mdash;rubies,
emeralds, pearls, and diamonds&mdash;in open-work,
or attached to velvet. They are generally constructed
so as to reach only half-way round the neck, the back
part being a band of black velvet. Portraits of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_318" id="page_318">{318}</a></span>time frequently exhibit ropes of pearls, and finally rows
of large diamonds, like the renowned <i>collier</i> of Marie
Antoinette composed by the Court jewellers Boehmer
and Bossange. Numerous circumstances connected
with it, too lengthy to relate here, gave to the <i>affaire</i> of
the diamond necklace a world-wide celebrity, making it
one of the chief events of the century. Though historically
one of the world's most famous pieces of jewellery,
the necklace itself, described in quaint but vivid
language by Carlyle in his <i>Miscellanies</i>, calls for no
special comment, being on the whole of comparatively
small artistic importance. Its value&mdash;&pound;90,000, a great
sum for those days&mdash;lay in the size and quality of the
brilliants and <i>pendeloques</i> of which it was composed.</p>

<p>A favourite point of adornment in female attire was
still the breast, where, in the first part of the century,
jewelled ornaments, or <i>s&eacute;vign&eacute;s</i>, in the form of bows
and rosettes, hung with pendants and set with table-cut
stones or rose diamonds, continued to be worn. Generally
they assumed the <i>girandole</i> shape hung with pear-shaped
pendants. About 1770 a large bunch of flowers,
or a bouquet-shaped ornament formed of precious stones,
was worn in the breast. For the latter the jeweller
Lempereur enjoyed a great reputation. Upon the stiff
bodice, which came into fashion at the end of the seventeenth
century, scope was afforded for a goodly use of
ornament, and soon we find the corsage literally covered
with jewels, in a manner similar to that in which the
ladies of the Renaissance almost completely covered
the upper part of their dresses with pendent chain-ornaments.
At the time, however, of which we now
speak the ornaments are single pieces mounted upon
the dress and arranged symmetrically in the form of
a jewelled "stomacher" or <i>devant de corsage</i>. The
Santini drawings contain many examples of this kind
of open framework composed of precious stones; and
several interesting designs for the same are figured on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_319" id="page_319">{319}</a></span>Plates 16, 17, and 18 of Maria's <i>Livre de Dessins de
Jouaillerie et de Bijouterie</i>. At this period also, when
luxury reached its climax, even the <i>panier</i> or tucked-up
upper skirt had the whole of its exaggerated dimensions
sprinkled with pieces of jewellery, so that of this time
again it may be said that the ladies of the Court displayed
the whole of their wealth, and often enough of
their credit too, upon a single dress.</p>

<p>Fashion endeavoured to fill a corresponding part in
gentlemen's attire by adorning coat and waistcoat with
buttons of artistic workmanship. To match the beautiful
embroidered garments of the time, buttons were
sewn with bugles, steel beads, or spangles; and many
have survived which may be reckoned as real articles
of jewellery. Every material and mode of decoration
was applied to them. Occasionally we find buttons set
with diamonds and other precious stones, but more
often paste, or with odd natural stones such as agates,
carnelians, marcasite, blood-stones, lapis-lazuli, or buttons
of tortoise-shell, or of compositions such as
Wedgwood ware, in frames of cut steel. Translucent
blue glass or enamel, mounted or set with pearls,
diamonds or pastes, and chased and coloured gold,
were all fashionable. On the whole, cut steel was the
most popular. A Birmingham craftsman by name
of Heeley, who worked for Wedgwood about 1780, is
recorded is being especially skilful at this class of
work; while in France a certain Dauffe had almost
a monopoly in the production of steel objects. Certainly
some of the open-work steel buttons of the time&mdash;English
as well as French&mdash;are jewels of a very high order.</p>

<p>Bracelets were mostly formed of bands of velvet
with oval clasps. The clasp was decorated in a variety
of ways, and was very frequently fitted with a painted
or enamelled miniature. The practice of wearing
miniatures in this way seems to have been a common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_320" id="page_320">{320}</a></span>one, judging by the numerous advertisements inserted
in the London <i>Public Advertiser</i> about the middle
of the century by "ingenious artists," willing on
"reasonable terms to paint elegant portraits in miniature
for bracelets, rings, etc." Madame de Chamillart
had amongst other jewels "Un petit portrait en mignature
en forme de bracelet garny de quatre diamants,
mont&eacute; en or." In fact, according to Fontenay, the
terms <i>bracelet</i> and <i>bo&icirc;te &agrave; portrait</i> had for a time
practically the same meaning.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Cameos were sometimes
employed as bracelet clasps, but not to the same
extent as they were subsequently under the Empire.
In the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at Paris are two portrait
cameos in sardonyx (Nos. 788 and 927) which served as
the clasps of the bracelets of Madame de Pompadour,
and were bequeathed by her to Louis XV in 1764. The
work of the celebrated gem-engraver Jacques Guay, the
one represents Henri IV, and the other, which is signed,
Louis XV. The mounting of each, an admirable example
of French jewel-work of the time, is formed
of a circlet of emeralds arranged in the manner of a
laurel wreath, and tied at intervals by cords of rose
diamonds terminating above and below in knots.
Among other decorations for bracelets, mention may
be made of the celebrated enamels produced at Battersea
between 1750 and 1775, very many of which, oval
in shape, were set in gold frames so as to be easily
mounted in bracelets. The productions of the rival
establishment at Bilston, in Staffordshire, were similarly
employed, and, like the former, were frequently worn as
buttons.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The finger ring in the eighteenth century was a
particularly favourite jewel. That considerable attention
was paid at the time to the design and decoration
of the ring, may be judged from Bourguet's designs,
which contain patterns for enamel-work intended for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_321" id="page_321">{321}</a></span>its enrichment. The beauty of the sentiments displayed
on the rings of the time is nowhere more charmingly
expressed than on an English wedding-ring at South
Kensington, which is formed of two hands in white
enamel, holding between the thumbs and first fingers
a rose diamond in the shape of a heart set in silver and
surmounted with a jewelled coronet. It bears the date
1706 (Pl. XXXVI, 3). Other rings of similar style have
the bezel formed of two precious stones in the form of
hearts united by a knot. Rings which served simply
as souvenirs of affection were very popular. In addition
to the plain gold ring engraved with a posy or motto,
were rings containing a like sentiment read by means
of the first letters of the stones with which they
are set.</p>

<p>The most typical ring of the period is perhaps the
<i>marquise</i> ring, which dates from the second half of
the century. The bezel, which is oblong, and either
oval or octagonal, is often of such size that it covers
the whole joint of the finger. It is formed of a plaque
of transparent blue glass on matted gold, surrounded
with diamonds, and set either with a single diamond,
or with several arranged at regular intervals, sometimes
in the form of a bouquet. Often instead of
diamonds are pastes and even marcasite. Of other
varieties of rings of the time it is necessary only to
mention those set with Wedgwood cameos, or with
stones such as moss-agates, and a form of agate somewhat
similar, but of lighter colour, called the mocha
stone. Mourning and memorial rings, of which this
period was so prolific, will be spoken of subsequently.</p>

<p>An ornament that showed a peculiarly wide development
throughout the eighteenth century was the shoe-buckle.
Various kinds of buckles are recorded in the
<i>Caution to the Public</i>, issued in 1733, in connection
with his famous ware, by Edward, the son of
Christopher Pinchbeck. They include the following:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_322" id="page_322">{322}</a></span>buckles for ladies' breasts, stock-buckles, shoe-buckles,
knee-buckles, girdle-buckles. Of these the most important
was the buckle worn on the shoes of every one&mdash;man
woman, and child&mdash;attached to the latchet or
strap passing over the instep. It assumed all sorts of
forms and was made and enriched with every conceivable
material. It is interesting to observe that in spite
of the immense number produced, hardly any two pairs
of buckles are precisely alike&mdash;this is shown in the case
of the collection of Sir S. Ponsonby Fane, which contains
upwards of four hundred specimens. Towards
the last years of the century buckles began to be supplanted
by shoe strings. During this period of transition
many attempts were made to foster their use.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> On
tickets to public entertainments at the time one
occasionally finds a notice that "Gentlemen cannot be
admitted with shoe strings." The latter, however, won
the day, and about the year 1800 shoe-buckles disappeared
from use.</p>

<p>The chatelaine was perhaps the most characteristic
of all eighteenth-century ornaments. It was exceedingly
popular, and formed, it may be observed, a
very favourite object of the time for a wedding present.
It usually consisted of a shield with a stout hook, suspended
from which were several chains united by
another plate or shield which carried the watch. Besides
this were two or more chains for holding the
watch-key or seals. Extraordinary skill was exercised
in the elaboration of chatelaines. The plaques, hinged
or united by chains, withstood the incursion of the
precious stone that dominated all other forms of
jewellery, and afforded peculiar opportunities for the
display of the art of the goldsmith in chased and
repouss&eacute; metal-work enriched with exquisite enamels.
The jeweller's whole artistic skill was thus exhibited,
not only upon the shields, but upon the solid links of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_323" id="page_323">{323}</a></span>the chains and upon the various breloques hung therefrom.
The chief of the latter was of course the watch.
Its dial-plate was enriched with enamel, and chased
and coloured gold: even the hands when made of gold
showed a high degree of skilled workmanship within
a very small space. The principal ornamental part was,
however, the outer case; and it may be maintained that
there was not any species of work connected with the
goldsmith's art that was not displayed in its finest form
upon watch-cases, more especially in the time of
Louis XVI.</p>

</div>

<p>Beside the watch was hung the watch-key and seals,
and all sorts of ornamental knick-knacks, as &eacute;tuis and
such-like. The elaborate chatelaine upon which nearly
every conceivable kind of trinket could be attached, is
the "equipage" thus described by Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu in her fourth <i>Town Eclogue</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Behold this equipage by Mathers wrought<br />
With fifty guineas (a great pen'orth!) bought!<br />
See on the tooth-pick Mars and Cupid strive,<br />
And both the struggling figures seem to live.<br />
Upon the bottom see the Queen's bright face;<br />
A myrtle foliage round the thimble case;<br />
Jove, Jove himself does on the scissars shine,<br />
The metal and the workmanship divine.</div></div></div>

<p>While women carried elaborate chatelaines, men
hung from the watch in the fob-pocket bunches of seals
which dangled beneath their embroidered waistcoats.
Thus in <i>Monsieur &agrave; la Mode</i>, published about 1753, we
read of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
A repeater by Graham, which the hours reveals;<br />
Almost overbalanced with nick-nacks and seals.</div></div></div>

<p>It was the seal above all which experienced particular
artistic development. Ever since the sixteenth century
the seal had been worn in addition to the signet ring.
Though hung perhaps like a pomander from a chain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_324" id="page_324">{324}</a></span>at the neck or from the girdle, the seal seems to have
been but rarely displayed on the person until the
general introduction in the early seventeenth century
of the watch, to which for more than a couple of centuries
it was a regular accompaniment. The majority
of seventeenth-century seals are of silver with the
arms engraved in the metal; others of steel are on
swivels and have three faces; others, again, of gold
set with stones engraved with heraldic devices, have
finely worked shanks, occasionally enriched with delicate
enamel-work. The gold seals of the eighteenth
century, which are among the best examples extant of
rococo jewellery, are of open-work in the form of
scroll and shell patterns, of admirable design and
workmanship. It is out of the question to attempt
a description of the numerous attractive forms these
pendent seals assumed, or the peculiar interest they
possess from an heraldic point of view.</p>

<p>About the year 1772 fashionable men carried a
watch in each fob-pocket, from which hung bunches of
seals and chains. From the custom set in England of
introducing masculine fashions into dress, ladies likewise
wore two watches, one on each side, together with
rattling breloques, seals, and other appendages. In
addition to the real watch with beautifully enamelled
back which adorned the left side, they wore on the
right what was called a <i>fausse montre</i> or false watch.
These false watches were, however, often little less costly
than the genuine article, being made of gold and silver,
with jewelled and enamelled backs. The front had
either an imitation dial-plate, some fanciful device, or
a pin-cushion. For those of less ample means the
<i>fausse montre</i> was made of gilt metal or even of
coloured foils.</p>

<p class="center"><b>NINETEENTH-CENTURY JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>THE MODERN REVIVAL</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">J</span>EWELLERY of the nineteenth century presents a
very variegated picture both as regards material
and technique, as well as in the display of every
conceivable style. It is not so much a particular
character of its own that has marked the jewellery
of each epoch of the century, as a peculiar form of reproduction
or rather reconstruction of older styles of art,
based for the most part on false traditions. The whole
period was an eclectic one, and the majority of its
productions&mdash;the result of nothing less than aimless
hesitation and fruitless endeavour to revive the forms
of the past&mdash;display at least doubtful taste. Throughout
the greater part of the time France led the fashion,
and every one of the political changes she underwent
left its mark on her artistic productions.</p>

<p>After the desolate epoch of the Revolution, under
which the whole standard of jewellery was measurably
lowered, a revival of something approaching luxury was
experienced under the Directory. This was succeeded
about the year 1800, owing to the stimulating dominance
of the First Consul, by circumstances of real
luxury. The period dating from Napoleon's accession
to the Imperial Dignity four years later, till about 1814,
was one of considerable importance in the history
of jewellery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_326" id="page_326">{326}</a></span></p><p>The severe and academic influence of the leading
and most popular artist of the day, the painter David,
and of his pupils, with their extravagant taste for the
antique, was universally felt. Yet while the antique
celebrated its triumph in all directions, the Empire failed
to shake itself entirely free from eighteenth-century
styles. As far indeed as jewellery was concerned, the
classical revival cannot be said to have been altogether
unhappy; for its ornaments are not without a certain
charm. Like all else, they breathed the spirit of the
past, and are not less formal and rigid than the other
art productions of the period.</p>

<p>It was under the short-lived reign of the associated
kings, termed the Directory, that the taste for the
antique first became thoroughly dominant. Jewellery
of all kinds assumed classical forms. The few individuals
who were fortunate enough to procure them wore
ancient Greek and Roman jewels; the rest had to be
content with facsimiles of objects discovered at Pompeii,
or simple copies adapted from representations on early
vase paintings, sculptures, or engraved gems.</p>

<p>So exaggerated became the enthusiasm for the
antique that, following the lead of Madame Tallien and
Madame R&eacute;camier, the fashionables of the period
adopted in its entirety, without regard for differences
of climate, what they deemed to be classical costume,
and appeared on public promenades in Paris with unstockinged
feet in sandals that allowed them to exhibit
jewels upon their toes.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The affected classicism of the Republic and First
Empire stimulated the use of engraved gems. Far
from cameos and the less decorative intaglios being
considered out of place with fine precious stones, they
often occupied positions of honour, surrounded and
mounted occasionally with important diamonds. In
the majority of cases, however, they were used alone
and were made up into special ornaments by themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_327" id="page_327">{327}</a></span>Antiques were worn when procurable, but the greater
number of gems were of modern manufacture, carefully
studied both as regards technique and style from
ancient examples. Somewhat later, small mosaics, on
which were figured classical subjects or buildings of
ancient Rome, were also employed. These, together
with cameos, generally on shell, were produced in quantities,
particularly in Italy, where cameo cutters and
mosaic workers still carry on a somewhat languishing
trade in ornaments of this nature, Venice, Florence, and
Rome sharing in the industry of mosaic jewellery;
Rome, Naples, and the whole of Southern Italy in that
of cameos. The production of both kinds of objects is
now in a sterilised condition. They have entirely lost
their earlier qualities, for the reason that they find but
little favour and have ceased to be worn by the upper
classes. Except during the height of the First Empire
the fashion for engraved gems never took a very thorough
hold. Ladies have seldom a taste for arch&aelig;ology. If a
few, in accordance with the current idea, affected a sober
and refined style of ornament, the majority soon wearied
of the burden of cameos in the necklace and bracelet,
and preferred sparkling stones to the delicate cutting
of the gem. The general and instinctive preference
for brilliant jewels did more than anything to kill
the attempted employment of antique forms and
designs.</p>

<p>As regards technique, the metal-work of the early
nineteenth century generally displayed considerable
poverty of material. The gold, if not pinchbeck imitation,
was usually thin, light, and of low quality, with
simple designs in the form of clusters of grapes.
Borders of leaves and flowers in the antique style were
stamped and chased sometimes in open-work, with
small rose-shaped ornaments applied. Granulated,
beaded, and purled work was much employed, and the
surface of the metal was often matted. Artistic effect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_328" id="page_328">{328}</a></span>in chased work was produced by the use of ornamental
inlays, or rather overlays, of coloured gold.</p>

<p>Actual jewel-work and settings, as a rule, displayed
good quality of workmanship. The general tendency
lay in the direction of the coloured stones popular in
ancient times&mdash;the topaz, peridot, aquamarine, and
amethyst; together with precious stones, such as
emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds, and with
pearls. The latter were generally reserved only for the
most sumptuous ornaments, but were occasionally used
in conjunction with jewels of less value. The stones
most commonly used were carnelians, moss-agates,
turquoises, garnets, pink and yellow topazes, as well
as coral, mingled together. Wedgwood ware and its
imitations, popular in the latter years of the eighteenth
century, continued for some time to meet with favour,
while paste jewellery was also worn to some extent.</p>

<p>On every species of jewellery the taste for the antique
was clearly visible. Ornaments for the head took the
form of frontlets and diadems, hair-combs, hair-pins,
triple chains, and strings of pearls. Earrings were in
general use, together with necklaces, brooches, bracelets,
rings, and girdles. The chief head-ornaments
were wide metal combs, fixed in the hair in such a
manner as to be visible from the front. The general
form of the Empire comb, with its upright rows of
pearls or coral, is well known, since a number of examples
exist. At the same time frontlets or <i>tours de
t&ecirc;te</i> were worn on the upper part of the forehead and
over the hair. These, enriched with pearls, cameos, or
precious stones, took the form of broad bands or
coronets. Another ornament, which did not, however,
come into fashion till about 1820, was the <i>ferronni&egrave;re</i>&mdash;a
band round the head, with a jewel in the middle of
the forehead. It was generally a fine gold chain, but
might be made of velvet ribbon or silken cord, or strings
of beads. The origin of its title has been given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_329" id="page_329">{329}</a></span>in connection with Italian jewellery of the fifteenth
century. Cameos and moss-agates entered largely
into the composition of necklaces as well as the
various coloured stones mentioned above. Cameos
often assumed considerable proportions. They were
occasionally set with precious stones, and were
linked together with fine chains. Bracelets were much
worn, three on each arm: one on the upper part of the
arm, a second just above the elbow, and a third upon
the wrist. They were usually composed of a number
of small chains, or even a band of velvet; while the clasp
was formed by a cameo, or else an amethyst, peridot, or
topaz set in stamped and pierced gold. Girdles for the
most part were fashioned in the same manner as bracelets,
with a large cameo on the clasp.</p>

<p>The pictures in the gallery at Versailles afford
perhaps the best idea of ornaments in the Empire
style; since jewellery is more clearly represented on
French portraits than on any others of the time. Among
the most striking of such portraits are those of Marie
Pauline, Princess Borghese, by Lef&egrave;vre, of Caroline
Buonaparte, Queen of Naples, by Madame Vig&eacute;e-Lebrun,
and of Madame M&egrave;re, by G&eacute;rard. The first
has a high comb and bandeau, earrings, and girdle, all
decorated with cameos, the second a parure of pearls
and cameos, and the third a head-ornament mounted
with a single large cameo. The coronation of Napoleon
in 1804 furnished the painter David with the subject of
a picture unrivalled in its kind&mdash;"Le Sacre de Napoleon
<span class="smcap">i</span><sup>er</sup> &agrave; Notre-Dame," which is exhibited in the Louvre.
This grandiose production, besides being a truly epic
rendering of a great historical event, serves as a valuable
document in the history of jewellery, in that it
represents jewellery of the most magnificent kind
carried by Josephine, the princesses, and the ladies of
honour. The Empress is shown wearing comb and
diadem of precious stones, brilliant earrings, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_330" id="page_330">{330}</a></span>bracelet on the wrist formed of two rows of jewels
united with a cameo. Her suite have, besides, necklaces
and girdles mounted in several cases with cameos.
Josephine herself possessed a perfect passion for engraved
gems, and she actually induced Napoleon to
have a number of antique cameos and intaglios removed
from the gem collection in the Royal Library and made
up into a complete parure of jewellery for her own use.</p>

<p>A German speciality of the expiring Empire was the
cast-iron jewellery, brought into favour largely on
account of the prevailing scarcity of gold and silver.
A foundry for its production was first set up in 1804 at
Berlin, where articles of great fineness were cast in sand
moulds. In the year 1813, the time of the rising against
the Napoleonic usurpation, more than eleven thousand
pieces of iron jewellery were turned out, and among
them five thousand crosses of the new order of the Iron
Cross. In that year appeared the well-known iron
rings. During the War of Liberation, when every man
joined the Prussian regiments to fight against the
French, the patriotic ladies who remained behind laid
at the Altar of the Fatherland their valuable jewels,
which were melted down for the benefit of the national
war-chest. For the articles thus surrendered they
received in exchange from the Government iron finger
rings bearing the words "Eingetauscht zum Wohle des
Vaterlandes," or the famous inscription "Gold gab ich
f&uuml;r Eisen." In addition to crosses and rings, other
jewels, such as diadems, necklaces, brooches, and bracelets,
were executed in cast iron, open-worked and in
relief (Pl. LI, 8). Complete parures comprising a comb,
necklace, earrings, and bracelets are not infrequently met
with, and the name of the manufacturer, such as "Geiss,
Berlin," etc., is sometimes found stamped on them.
Most of the work is in the antique taste, and is occasionally
adorned with classical heads in the manner of
Wedgwood and Tassie. Considering the material and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_331" id="page_331">{331}</a></span>method of production, the fineness and lace-like delicacy
of this iron jewellery is little less than marvellous.</p>

<div class="box">

</div>

</div>

<p>Another kind of nineteenth-century ornament, particularly
popular in the first half of the century, was
hair jewellery. It was favoured possibly in some cases
less by inclination than by that necessity which had
originally led the way for the use of iron and other less
valuable materials. Finger rings, bracelets, necklaces,
and watch-chains were plaited of the hair of the departed,
brooches and medallions mounted with it, and even
ornamental landscapes constructed of strands of human
hair. Hair was worn as a gift of affection from the
living; but it was chiefly employed for mourning or
memorial jewellery. It will be referred to again when
mourning jewellery is dealt with.</p>

<p>We enter about the year 1830 into the Romantic
period&mdash;the days of the heroines of Balzac, the days
when Byron and Ossian were <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, the days of a
fancy chivalry and medi&aelig;val sentimentality, of Sir Walter
Scott, and above all of the Gothic revival. Gothic
motives, rampant in architecture, make their appearance
also on bookbindings, furniture, and other things, and
influence jewellery to a certain degree. Among the
leaders of the movement so far as it affected jewellery
were the goldsmiths Froment Meurice, and Robin,
whose productions, executed in accordance with the
Romantic taste, assumed the form of armoured knights,
on foot, or fully equipped on horseback, lords and ladies
in medi&aelig;val costume, and jewels which took the shape
of compositions of a similar "elegant" nature.</p>

<p>At this period cameos were still worn, but seldom of
strictly classical character. Sentimental hair jewellery
likewise continued, as did the iron jewellery. The
latter, however, no longer displayed classical forms, but
debased Gothic designs. Chains of various kinds were
in considerable favour. They were usually looped up
at intervals with circular or oblong plaques of thin and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_332" id="page_332">{332}</a></span>coloured gold set with small turquoises and garnets.
With the development of machinery appeared thin goldwork,
ornamented with stamped and pressed designs.
Work of this kind, characteristic of its first decades,
extended far into the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>As far as men's jewellery is concerned there is little
or nothing to chronicle. Strangely enough, the masculine
delight in splendid jewels that had existed up to
the end of the eighteenth century, came all at once to
an end, along with that older world on the ruins of
which Napoleon rose. Almost all that remained to them
was the bunch of seals, often of considerable size, that
hung by a silken cord from the fob. It is true that
occasionally beaux and macaronis actually wore earrings.
But these were not employed solely as ornaments, but
largely as the result of a fanciful idea, still prevalent in
certain quarters, of the value of such objects against
diseases of the eye.</p>

<p>Fashion next, about the middle of the century,
harked back to rococo, and imitated the style of
Louis XV. It was rococo of a kind, but lay as far
from the eighteenth century as did Romantic Gothic
from the Gothic of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Design for the most part was deplorably bad, defects
in this direction being passed off under a glitter of
stones.</p>

<p>Instead of the close setting which had so long satisfied
the jeweller, open setting for precious stones became
universal. Countless old and valuable ornaments
perished. The diamonds and other precious stones
were picked out of them and transferred to newer settings,
and the beautiful old metal-work was ruthlessly
melted down. Many fine jewels during the course of
the nineteenth century have likewise been spoiled and
reduced in value by their owners attempting to adapt
them to a prevailing fashion. Vast is the number of
family treasures that have undergone the fate of remounting.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_333" id="page_333">{333}</a></span>It is to be hoped that the new-born interest
in the beautiful work of earlier craftsmen may help to
save what is left from the same sort of destruction that
the ancient churches of our land have undergone as the
result of ill-judged "restoration."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>THE MODERN REVIVAL</b></p>

<p>Long prior to the developments that have taken
place in recent years, attention had been attracted to
the artistic qualities of gold and an impetus given to
the manipulation of the simple material. It was early
in the "sixties" that notice was first drawn to the gold
jewellery then being executed in Rome, and the discoveries
that had been effected in the working of the
wrought metal by the firm of Castellani.</p>

<p>The head of this famous family was the goldsmith
Fortunato Pio Castellani, one of the best-known jewellers
and dealers of his day. In 1814, at an early age,
he started a business in Rome, which he developed
about 1826 on the lines of the antique work. The
process of production of the old granulated gold jewellery
of the ancient Etruscans&mdash;that in which the surface
is covered with minute grains of gold set with
absolute regularity&mdash;had long been a puzzle and problem
to jewellers. Castellani was deeply interested in the
lost art, and searched Italy through to find some survival
of it. At last in St. Angelo in Vado, a village of the Apennines,
in the corner of the Umbrian Marches, he found a
caste of local goldsmiths who had preserved it in what
seemed to be an unbroken tradition. He transported
some of them to Rome, and together with his sons
Alessandro and Augusto succeeded in imitating the
tiny golden grains of the Etruscans and soldering
them on to the surface of jewels. The work he accomplished
in this direction has become famous all the
world over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_334" id="page_334">{334}</a></span></p><p>In 1851 Fortunato retired, and on his death in
1865 his property was divided&mdash;Augusto retaining the
business, Alessandro setting himself up as a collector
and dealer. Augusto, born 1829, carried on the traditions
of his father's atelier, and was afterwards promoted
to the Directorship of the Capitoline Museum.</p>

<p>Alessandro, the elder brother, was perhaps one of
the most striking personalities of his age. Born in
1824, he first assisted his father; but his political
opinions, which led him to take an active part in the
revolutionary movement in Rome in 1848, and implicated
him in the conspiracy of 1852, resulted in his imprisonment
in the Castle of St. Angelo; but successfully feigning
madness, he was liberated and sent out of the Pontifical
States. He then proceeded to travel about exploiting
the productions of the Casa Castellani. Gradually he
devoted himself to arch&aelig;ological pursuits. His knowledge
of these matters was profound, and he became the
finest expert of his day. He was continually collecting,
and dealt largely, his chief customers being the
museums of Europe and America. The finest of the
antique jewellery in the British Museum was purchased
from him in 1872-1873. A few years before, in 1867, his
unrivalled series of peasant ornaments, gathered together
from all parts of Italy, was acquired by the
Victoria and Albert Museum, which also made large
purchases at the sale that took place after his death in
1883.</p>

<p>The art of filigree and granulation practised by
Castellani was carried to still greater perfection by
another Italian, Carlo Giuliano, who was largely indebted
to the discoveries of his compatriot. Examples
of his work, with that of Castellani, are in the Victoria
and Albert Museum. Since his death, his business
house in London has been continued by his sons.</p>

<p>Another Italian who has surpassed both Castellani
and Giuliano in the reproduction of the antique is Melillo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_335" id="page_335">{335}</a></span>of Naples. His jewellery, though "copied closely
from ancient models, has a certain modern <i>cachet</i>" and
is in fact "a translation of the most refined ancient
art into modern language."</p>

<p>An eminent English jeweller, whose name is worthy
of record, was Robert Phillips of London, who died in
1881. He also came under the influence of Castellani.
At the same time he was responsible for the production
of some of the most original work executed in England
during the Victorian era.</p>

<p>A forerunner in France of the modern movement
in artistic jewellery, and one entitled to a high place in
the history of the art, was the goldsmith Lucien Falize
(b. 1838), who was a partner with M. Bapst, crown
jeweller of the Second Empire. He succeeded Bapst
as official goldsmith to the French Government, and
died in 1897. Another great French jeweller was
Eug&egrave;ne Fontenay, author of the important history of
jewellery, who died in 1885.</p>

<p>Side by side with the improvement in taste which
during the last few years has prompted people to preserve
old jewellery, and a genuine love for its peculiar
and indefinable attractions which has induced them to
collect it, the present age has witnessed a truly remarkable
revival in the artistic production of articles of
personal ornament. The general awakening that has
taken place in the industrial arts has nowhere made its
influence more strongly felt than in respect to jewellery.
Owing to the example set by the highest artistic spirits,
which has affected even the ordinary productions of
commerce, there has arisen a new school of jewellery,
the residue of which, when the chaff of eccentricity on
the one hand and coarse workmanship on the other
is winnowed from it, consists in works which combine
the charm and sense of appropriateness requisite to
objects of personal adornment with qualities that mark
them as individual works of art.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_336" id="page_336">{336}</a></span></p><p>The ornaments of the past reveal an elemental truth
of art which it may be to the ultimate advantage of
the decorative artificer of modern times to study and
to imitate. They show, particularly in their most
refined periods, that the simplest materials and the
simplest modes of decoration can be associated with
beauty of form and purity of design, and that the
value of a personal ornament does not consist solely
in the commercial cost of the materials, but rather in
the artistic quality of its treatment. In the revival of the
arts in the latter part of the nineteenth century the
artistic styles of the past began to be carefully studied,
and for the first time were brought together and exhibited
as models. They have undoubtedly exercised a
profound influence both on design and technique. It is
well at the same time to remember that personal
ornaments, as indeed all productions of former times,
which are thus shown in museums, must not be
reckoned with from one standpoint only. The intention
of their public display is to afford material for instruction,
investigation, and inspiration, for the craftsman,
the student, and the "man in the street." Their function
in this respect is not only to produce artists and
craftsmen, or even connoisseurs, but to inspire the lay
public with a love of beauty, and to induce a divine
discontent with the ugliness with which it is surrounded.</p>

<p>Though it is very well to use and reproduce the
forms and motives of the past, an indefinite persistence
in that attitude is liable to be construed as a confession
of &aelig;sthetic sterility. But while empty revivals and
false adaptations are to be rejected, the reckless race
after originality, resulting in the eccentricity which is
so rife in modern art, should especially be avoided. It
is the desire for originality instead of a modest devotion
to fine workmanship, "a love for the outrageous
and the <i>bizarre</i>, and a lack of proportion, both in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_337" id="page_337">{337}</a></span>form and in choice of material," that has ruined much
of the jewellery produced under the <i>Nouveau Art</i>
movement.</p>

<p>If colour and form produced by a study of harmony
and a limited appeal to nature could be united to
elaboration and minuteness of finish, with symmetrical
arrangements freed from purely mechanical detail of
ornament; if more insight could be obtained into the
spirit which produced those splendid fragments that
have survived from the past, there would be a gradual
return to a style of work wherein the inherent preciousness
of material might be accompanied by a fuller
appreciation of its artistic possibilities, and a way
opened to the restoration of the art of the goldsmith to
the honourable place it once held.</p>

<p>Apart from matters of design the new movement
has resulted in great changes in the artistic aspect of
jewellery. In distinction to the tendency hitherto prevalent
which bids the metal mounting of jewellery to
be rendered almost invisible, the working of gold and
silver has once again become a matter of some moment.
A second change, due to the study of old models, has
been the revival of enamelling&mdash;an art which offers
many an opportunity for the exercise of the craftsman's
taste and skill, and has once again resumed its proper
position as handmaid to the goldsmith. A third
change has been the wider choice and employment
of stones. Till recent years only those stones that
are reckoned as fine&mdash;the diamond, ruby, emerald,
and sapphire&mdash;have been allowed a place in jewellery.
Though their commercial value can never be set aside,
precious stones are now valued, as they were in Renaissance
times, for the sake of their decorative properties.
The taste for colour effects in jewellery has
resulted in the adoption of certain gems not very
precious, yet sufficiently rare, while the artistic value
of broken colour in gems is beginning to be appreciated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_338" id="page_338">{338}</a></span>in purely commercial productions. There is now
a welcome tendency to use such stones as the aquamarine,
peridot, zircon, topaz, tourmaline, chrysoprase,
and others of beautiful colour and high decorative
value. For a precious stone, as has been truly said,
"is not beautiful because it is large, or costly, or
extraordinary, but because of its colour, or its position
in some decorative scheme."</p>

<p>The present master of the jeweller's art is Ren&eacute;
Lalique of Paris, universally recognised as the greatest
of modern artists in this class of the fine handicrafts.
He possesses a perfect mastery over materials of all
sorts, even of such as ivory, horn, and mother-of-pearl,
and above all enamel, especially that in open settings.
To his wonderful dexterity of technique he unites a
fertile imagination and infinite resource of design in
the direction of naturalistic forms, as flowers, winged
insects, and human figures.</p>

<p>The style of Lalique, freed entirely as it is from
the forms of tradition, is carried out by several artists
of individual talent, such as Lucien Gaillard, Gaston
Laffitte, Georges Fouquet, Comte du Suau de la Croix,
Vever, Ren&eacute; Foy, and Louis Bonny. It has, in addition,
hosts of imitators, whose productions are wrought
with rare skill, but display, nevertheless, singular disregard
of appropriateness and utility, and are further
marred in many cases by eccentricities of design.</p>

<p>Much original, if not always very attractive, work
has been produced also in Germany and Austria since
the full expansion of the <i>Nouveau Art</i> movement about
the year 1897. Among the first in Germany to display
activity in the design and production of jewellery in
the new style have been the artists Hirzel and M&ouml;hring,
and Piloty of Munich. Van der Velde, Olbrich, and
Schaper and J. H. Werner of Berlin have all obtained
a reputation for their work in this direction. The
movement has been fostered with success in the leading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_339" id="page_339">{339}</a></span>art schools, under the superintendence of Gnauth
at Nuremberg, Hammer and G&ouml;ss at Karlsruhe, Graff
at Stuttgart and Dresden, and Luthmer at Frankfort.
The chief centres in Germany for the production of
jewellery are Pforzheim, Hanau, and Gm&uuml;nd. The
leading craftsmen of Pforzheim are Zerrenden, Fahrner,
Friessler, and Stoffler; while Gm&uuml;nd possesses the well-known
jeweller Hermann Bauer.</p>

<p>Among the leaders of the new art movement in
Austria are the sculptor Gurschner, Dietrich, Prutscher,
and Franz Hauptmann; while Elsa Unger,
Anna Wagner, and Eugenie Munk have carried out
distinctive work on the same lines. Belgium has
produced some able craftsmen in the persons of Paul
Dubois the sculptor, Ph. Wolfers, and Van Strydonck.
The modern school of Denmark possesses the artists
Slott-M&ouml;ller, Bindesb&ouml;ll, Magnussen, and Bollin.</p>

<p>England, the pioneer of the latter-day renaissance
of the decorative arts, can boast of a number of craftsmen
of distinction in artistic jewellery. Among the
leaders of the movement whose style and individuality
have secured them recognition are Mr. H. Wilson,
Mr. Henry H. Cunynghame, Mr. and Mrs. Nelson
Dawson, Mr. C. R. Ashbee, Mr. Harold Stabler, Mr.
Edgar Simpson, Mr. Alexander Fisher, Mrs. Bethune,
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Gaskin, Mrs. Newman, Mrs.
Traquair, Mrs. Hadaway, Mr. and Mrs. Partridge, and
Mr. F. S. Robinson. One may also name H.H. Princess
Louise Augusta of Schleswig-Holstein, and H.H.
the Ranee of Sarawak, in addition to a number of others
whose work has figured in exhibitions such as those
held by the Arts and Crafts Society. The name of
Mr. A. Lazenby Liberty, who has done much to foster
new design in England, likewise deserves mention.</p>

<p>Messrs. Tiffany of New York have shown how
artistic design may be combined with fine and rare
gems&mdash;the natural instinct for which will have to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_340" id="page_340">{340}</a></span>gratified so long as jewellery is worn. A number of
other firms both in England and France have in
recent years displayed remarkable advance in this
direction, also, as in the case of Messrs. Boucheron,
in a skilful combination of coloured stones, as well as
in a reserved use of enamel.</p>

<p>A hopeful sign for the future of this refined art is
the thoroughness with which it is taught in schools of
art throughout the country, and the eagerness and success
with which it is practised also by a number of
gifted amateurs. The work produced, though far behind
that of continental craftsmen in point of execution,
avoids many of the extravagances of the "new art,"
and exhibits, for the most part, taste and reserve in
design, and adaptability to ultimate uses.</p>

<p class="center"><b>PEASANT JEWELLERY</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">U</span>NTIL the middle of the nineteenth century the
peasants and natives of every country district
of Europe wore modest gold and silver
jewellery, of small pecuniary value, but of great artistic
interest. A few years ago peasant jewellery was seldom
sought for, and comparatively unknown; and collectors,
better informed in other respects, did not think of
saving it from the melting-pot. It is now, however,
beginning to attract some of the attention it
deserves.</p>

<p>This old peasant jewellery has at the present day
nearly all passed out of the hands of its original
owners. The chief cause of its disappearance has
been increased facilities for travelling, which resulted
in jewellery fashioned wholesale in industrial centres
being distributed to the remotest rural districts. The
demands of the modern collector, and improvements
in present-day taste among certain of the cultured
classes, which have led to the adoption of old articles
of jewellery for personal use, have also contributed to
the disappearance of peasant jewellery in recent years.
The wiles of the dealer have induced peasants to yield
up heirlooms, which, handed down for generations, have
escaped the fate of the jewels of the wealthy and more
fashionable. The great museums of art and industry
springing up everywhere, especially in Germany, have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_342" id="page_342">{342}</a></span>all obtained a generous share of the spoil, and have
preserved it from what, until lately, would have been
inevitable destruction.</p>

<p>So completely in most parts has this old jewellery
gone out of use among the peasantry, that hardly a
trace remains of a once flourishing industry carried on
by local craftsmen working on traditional lines, and
untrammelled by the artistic fashion of the moment.
Machines driven by steam power have crushed out of
existence skill to make things by hand, and the cold
and monotonous production of the artisan has taken
the place of the old work, whose peculiarly attractive
character is due to its expressing the fresh ideas and
inspiration of the artist.</p>

<p>The French peasant jewel <i>par excellence</i> is the
cross. It is suspended from the neck by a velvet
ribbon, and varies in form according to localities. Its
size is often in proportion to the social condition of the
wearer. Sometimes it attains considerable dimensions.
Fixed upon the velvet ribbon, and drawing it together
just above the cross is a slide or <i>coulant</i>, in the form
of a bow, rosette, or heart, and of the same style as the
cross itself. In many provinces of France, such as
Savoy, gold is reserved exclusively for married women&mdash;custom
having it that all their jewels should be of
that metal. Silver, on the other hand, is often employed
solely for girls' jewellery, possibly because it is
considered the natural symbol of virginal purity, just
as in ancient times it was consecrated to the virgin
goddess, Diana.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The most interesting and perhaps the best-known
French peasant jewellery is that of Normandy and the
Auvergne. The chief Norman jewel is the cross. The
most usual form is that which occurs in the districts
round St. L&ocirc; and Caen. It is of silver, formed of five
high bosses, four round and one pear-shaped, each set
with a large foiled rock crystal (commonly known as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_343" id="page_343">{343}</a></span><i>Diamant</i>, <i>Caillou</i>, or <i>Pierre d' Alen&ccedil;on</i>) cut and faceted
in the brilliant shape, and further ornamented with
sprays set with small crystals in rose form. The lower
limb of the cross, <i>briolette</i> or pear-shaped, is hinged, so
as to render it less liable to get bent or broken in wear
(Pl. LIII, 4). The spaces between the limbs are sometimes
completely filled up with branched open-work set
with small crystals. In the more northerly parts of
France the cross is formed simply of large bosses set
with crystals; but round about Rouen we meet with an
abundance of spray-work. Other crosses of considerable
size are formed of thin plates of pierced gold. The
shape of the cross is indicated simply by crystal bosses,
but its form is almost lost in the outline of the jewel.
A favourite subject for representation on Rouennais
jewellery is the <i>Saint Esprit</i> or Holy Dove. Employed
as a breast-ornament or pendant, the Dove
is either in gold or silver, mounted with crystals,
or coloured pastes set close together. It is suspended
from an ornament of open knot design, with a rosette-shaped
slide above. In its beak is a branch, spray, or
bunch of grapes, generally of coloured pastes. Peasant
jewellery ceased to be worn in Normandy about 1840,
when native costume was given up.</p>

<p>While Normandy relies chiefly on crystal quartz for
its jewellery, the Auvergne can boast of a variety
of gems, such as garnets, opals, spinels, and zircons,
which are of frequent occurrence in the volcanic rock
of Central France. The jewellery of Puy is mounted
with cabochon stones in large high settings. Open-work
circular pendants have a central boss with eight similar
settings around. The <i>Saint Esprit</i> is also a popular
jewel, but in these parts the form of the Dove is not
completely carried out, the jewel being composed merely
of five pear-shaped bosses to indicate the wings, body,
head, and tail of the bird.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the patterns of the jewels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_344" id="page_344">{344}</a></span>here alluded to are not entirely original inventions
of the peasantry. As a matter of fact, they are often
from precisely the same models as the jewellery in use
in the seventeenth and early part of the eighteenth
century, and are very similar in style to the large
series of original designs in the National Art Library,
South Kensington, executed about that time by the
Santini family of Florence. Their technique is also
traditional. This is shown by the presence on many
of the peasant jewels of Southern France, as well as
of other districts, of the painted enamel which came in
about 1640, and continued in use for upwards of a
century. While fashion has shifted scores of times
since those days, types and styles of jewellery then set
remained unchanged in these quarters until the great
industrial revolution of the nineteenth century and the
strange and universal decline of taste that accompanied
it.</p>

<p>Holland is one of the few countries that have retained
their peasant jewellery. Not only is it displayed
in abundance on festal occasions, such as weddings, but
it is worn in everyday life by the well-to-do natives
of the country districts. Much jewellery is employed
in Zeeland. The country belles wear jutting out on
either side of the lace cap curious corkscrew-like ornaments
of gold, silver, or gilt metal, on which they hang
pendants sometimes tipped with pearls. In the land
of Goes a square gold ornament is pinned close to the
face inside the lace halo that surrounds the head.
Coral necklaces are worn, and jet ones for mourning.
Boys have earrings and gold and silver buttons near
the throat. The head-ornaments of North Holland and
Utrecht consist of a broad thin band of gold or silver
which encircles the skull and terminates at each end
with the above-mentioned spiral ornaments. These
bands are covered by a white muslin cap or by a cap
decorated with coloured designs. The women of Gelderland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_345" id="page_345">{345}</a></span>display costly caps of gold beaten out to fit each
individual head. In Overyssel the lace cap terminates
with gold ornaments, and the coral necklace has clasps
of gold filigree. Men and boys wear flat silver buttons
on the coat and gold at the collar. At the waist is
a pair of large hammered discs of silver. The natives
of the fertile country of Friesland possess vast stores
of jewellery, generally of gold set with diamonds.</p>

<p>Very attractive peasant ornaments are still in use in
Belgium. Long pendent crosses are worn, with earrings
to match. They are of open-work floral and scroll
designs, and are mounted with small rosettes set with
rose diamonds&mdash;silver rosettes being applied to gold
ornaments, gold to silver ones. The slide or <i>coulant</i>
above the cross here forms part of the pendant, and is
not, as in France, attached by the ribbon worn with it.
The heart (<i>Sacr&eacute; C&oelig;ur</i>) is not worn above the cross, as
in France, but is used as a distinct ornament, as a rule
in silver only. These open-work heart pendants, commonly
found between Antwerp and Malines, and rarely
elsewhere, have an opening in the centre hung with a
movable setting, and a hinged crown-shaped ornament
above. Instead of a crown is sometimes a <i>fl&egrave;che</i>,
two quivers and a bow&mdash;a love token. Flemish jewels,
unlike the French, are set entirely with rose diamonds.</p>

<p>The peasant jewellery of Norway and Sweden is
mainly of silver filigree. Precious stones do not take
an important place in it. When used they are more
often than not false, and are only sparingly applied for
the sake of their colour. Particularly characteristic
of almost all the ornaments of these parts are numerous
small concave or saucer-like pieces of metal, highly
polished, or small flat rings. They are suspended by
links, particularly from the large circular buckle which
is the chief article of jewellery. Most ornaments are
circular in plan. Besides being executed in filigree,
many of them are embossed or else cast&mdash;a style of work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_346" id="page_346">{346}</a></span>admirably displayed on the huge silver-gilt crowns worn
by Scandinavian brides.</p>

<p>The peasant ornaments of Germany present many
varieties of design. Silver filigree of various kinds is
employed for almost all of them. In the northern
districts amber beads are naturally the commonest form
of necklace, while hollow balls of silver are also worn
strung together. Large flat hair-pins are used, the
expanded heads of which are ornamented with raised
filigree. Swiss and Tyrolese peasant jewellery is largely
composed of garnets or garnet-coloured glass set in
silver filigree.</p>

<p>So numerous are the different types of Italian
peasant jewels that it is impossible to mention them all.
Every small district, nay, every township, seems to
have possessed ornaments that differed in some detail
from those of its neighbours. Many of them display
reminiscences of the antique. Their manufacture follows&mdash;or
did till quite recent years&mdash;the old methods;
the natives of certain out-of-the-way districts in Umbria
still working in very much the same manner as the
ancient Etruscans. All ornaments are somewhat voluminous.
The head is uncovered, and presents an
extensive field for hair-ornaments. The Lombards
have all sorts of hair-pins, often a couple of dozen,
stuck in nimbus fashion, and through them crosswise
is passed another pin with an oval head at each end.
Earrings are likewise of considerable dimensions, but
light in spite of their size. Their surfaces are very
frequently set with seed pearls. The finest existing
collection of Italian peasant jewellery is that in the
Victoria and Albert Museum, purchased from Signor
Castellani in 1867. Of great beauty is the jewellery of
the shores of the Adriatic, and that of the Greek
Islands, probably made by descendants of the Venetian
goldsmiths, and commonly known by the title of "Adriatic"
jewellery (Pl. LIV). It is of thin gold, on which are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_347" id="page_347">{347}</a></span>shallow cells filled with opaque enamels. Crescent-shaped
earrings are formed of pendent parts hung with
double pearls. Dating from the seventeenth century
are elaborate and delicate pendants in the shape of fully
rigged ships enriched with painted enamel and hung
with clusters of pearls. Beautiful work of a similar
nature was also produced in Sicily.</p>

<p>Hungarian and Spanish peasant ornaments have
already been alluded to. In both these countries we
find the native filigree enamel in sixteenth-century work,
and painted enamel in that of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. Spanish jewellery frequently takes
the form of pendent reliquaries. It is usually of stout
silver filigree, bearing traces of Moorish design. The
Moorish style is also felt on Portuguese jewellery, which
displays in addition a certain amount of what appears
to be Indian influence. It is composed of gold filigree
of very fine workmanship. Earrings and neck-chains
are of such proportions that they reach respectively to
the shoulders and the waist. In addition to the cross,
star, heart, and crescent-shaped pendants are worn. A
favourite form is one resembling an inverted artichoke.
Openings are left in its surface, and within these spaces
and on the edges of the jewel are hung little trembling
pendants (Pl. LIII, 2). Portuguese jewellery of the
eighteenth century, largely set with crystal, is admirably
represented in the Museum of Fine Arts at Lisbon.</p>

<p class="center"><b>JEWELLERY IN PICTURES</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>NE aspect of the present subject, more attractive
perhaps than any other, is that which concerns
the representation of personal ornaments in
pictures. Scarcely as yet have pictures been fully
appreciated from the point of view of their utility to
antiquaries or the light they throw upon matters of
historical inquiry. The important part which from the
fifteenth century onwards they have played in connection
with the subject of jewellery is sufficiently attested
by the number of times they have already been referred
to during the course of the present inquiry.</p>

<p>The truth, reality, and accuracy of the artists' work has
eminently contributed to the value of these pictures. A
sympathetic way of seeing things and reproducing them
and a fine feeling for naturalistic detail is characteristic
of all the work of the painters of early times, when a
strength of realism made its wholesome influence
universally felt. Such works, while they display the
grandeur and magnificence of former ages and point
out the fashions and customs of our ancestors, show
in detail not only the bright splendour of patterned
draperies in many materials, but also the shimmer of
goldsmith's work in the form of a variety of actual
ornaments, now for the most part entirely lost. In this
way they set before us details unnoticed by chroniclers,
and convey clearer ideas than can be attained by reading
the most elaborate descriptive inventories.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_349" id="page_349">{349}</a></span></p><p>The special capability of the early painters for representing
articles of jewellery need merely be alluded to
again, seeing the close connection already shown, that
always existed between them and the goldsmiths, in
whose workshops most of them passed their apprenticeship.
Every jewelled ornament figured in their works
is, in fact, designed with the full knowledge of a goldsmith
versed in his craft.</p>

<p>The artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
are notorious for the extreme and elaborate minuteness
of their painting of jewels. In the portraits of the time
careful accuracy in depicting ornaments was the duty,
and evidently the delight, of the painter. In every early
picture the various details of costume and jewellery are
rendered with scrupulous care and refinement. Though
placed in the most prominent and decorative positions,
jewellery was never, in the best works, allowed to
intrude or to occupy an exaggerated place in the
composition. For however minutely defined these
accessories may be, they are so fused into the general
design that they are only apparent if one takes the
trouble to look for them.</p>

<p>In addition to recognised masterpieces, there exists
a vast number of pictures obviously not by the first
masters, which, though of only moderate quality, do not
actually offend by their inferiority. These equally well
serve to illustrate details of jewellery and dress. In a
picture of the first order such details, of importance
in themselves, sink into insignificance beside the
splendid qualities of a work of art: in less important
pictures the ornamental accessories are all in all.
It would be of great value to students if all public
collections that possess costumes and ornaments
could bring together&mdash;as has been done with marked
success in the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg&mdash;series
of portraits specially chosen to illustrate these
details, such portraits, like the actual articles of dress
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_350" id="page_350">{350}</a></span>and jewellery, being, of course, old ones, not modern
copies.</p>

<p>We may state, in general, that jewels figured in
portraits are to be relied upon as being the actual
objects possessed by the persons represented. All the
early painters displayed, as has been said, a special love
for jewel forms. They not only took their beautiful
models as they found them, but being themselves
mostly masters of the jeweller's craft, they devoted
much attention to the adornment and the arrangement
of the jewels of their models. It may be urged that
painters are apt to indulge their fancy by decorating
their sitters with jewels they do not possess, introduced
to improve the colour or arrangement of the picture, or
introduced in accordance with orders, like those of the
good Mrs. Primrose, who expressly desired the painter
of her portrait to put in as many jewels as he could for
the money, and "not to be too frugal of his diamonds
in her stomacher and hair."</p>

<p>It is unlikely, on the contrary, that any of the early
painters departed from their usual methods of truth,
reality, and accuracy; or, considering the elaborate
detail with which they depicted jewellery, that they ever
specially invented it for the portrait in which it occurs.
It is much more probable that they worked from what
they saw: for masters of painting have in all ages
worked from models in preference to carrying out their
own designs. An instance may be cited of the care
which painters paid to the ornaments of their sitters.
Preserved in the Archivio di Casa Gerini at Florence
are certain unpublished documents<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> of the years 1579 to
1584 relating to the artist Alessandro Allori, in which
is a list of the clothes and jewels that had been lent
him from the wardrobe of the Grand Duchess, Bianca
Cappello, when he was painting her portrait.</p>

<p>One or two of the peculiarities of artists in representing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_351" id="page_351">{351}</a></span>jewellery are worthy of being mentioned. It is
to be observed that the presence or absence of gilding
on jewellery often serves to distinguish between German
and Flemish paintings. Holbein almost always employed
gold upon golden objects; but in the works of
Mabuse, so rich in elaborate detail, paint alone suffices
to produce the effect. The artists of those days possessed
a marvellous facility for imitating the brilliance
of gold by colour alone.</p>

<p>In examining the jewellery of sixteenth and seventeenth
century portraits numbers of what appear to be
black stones are frequently to be seen. These were
evidently intended to represent diamonds. From early
times, when the custom existed of improving, as it was
considered, the colour of all stones by the use of foils,
diamonds&mdash;the old stones of Golconda and Brazil, different
in colour and quality from the diamonds of
to-day&mdash;were usually backed with a black varnish composed
of lamp-black and oil of mastic. This <i>tinctura</i>,
or colouring of the diamond, which is alluded to by
Cellini, would account for the intense and clear blacks
and whites used by the artists of the time in depicting
that precious stone.</p>

<p>In the work of some of the finest painters of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, so masterly is the
handling, that in the contemplation of broad effects one
may fail to notice how much detail the artists were able
to combine with such breadth. In fact the detail they
displayed is hardly less precise than that of the earlier
painters. Mr. Davies<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> has some interesting remarks
to make on the different modes of depicting jewellery
adopted by first-class painters&mdash;by the one who paints
it in detail and the other who treats it with freedom.
"The first paints you, touch by touch, his chains, his
bracelets, his tiara, link by link, and gem by gem, with
precision so great that if you called in a fairly capable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_352" id="page_352">{352}</a></span>goldsmith, of little or no intelligence, he would use
them as a pattern and produce you an exact facsimile.
The second obtains his result by summarized knowledge,
letting his line lose itself and find itself again,
a flash on a link, a sparkle on a gem suggesting
all to the eye with a completeness which is fully as
complete as the literal word for word translation of the
other man. Call in a really intelligent goldsmith to
this work and he would find it quite as easy as, or even
easier than, the other to understand and reproduce
from, but it would not do to make a tracing from, nor
give as a pattern to one of his unintelligent apprentices."</p>

<p>Very attractive and valuable guides to the jewellery
of the early period are the early Flemish-Burgundian
paintings (p. 90), and those of the Italian masters of
the fifteenth century (p. 167). The most fertile of sixteenth-century
pictures for the present purpose are the
German (p. 189), as may be judged from Herr Luthmer's
<i>Goldschmuck der Renaissance</i>, in which are reproduced
in colours a number of specimens of jewellery figured
in contemporary pictures. In the second half of the
sixteenth century and the early part of the seventeenth,
the painters of the Low Countries especially excelled
in the delineation of jewel forms. Among these artists
are Sir Antonio More, Peter Pourbus, Lucas de Heere,
Zucchero, Marc Gheeraerts, D. Mytens, Van Somer,
and Janssens. By these and by numerous followers
of Holbein, many pictures were painted, and exist
in England at the present day. The technique of the
great Dutch and Flemish painters of the seventeenth
century, even of such as Frans Hals, was not incompatible,
as Mr. Davies has shown, with the clear representation
of personal ornaments.</p>

<p>The majority of pictures of the early part of the
eighteenth century offer but slight indication of the
jewellery of the time. The conventional style of portraiture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_353" id="page_353">{353}</a></span>which then found favour did not allow such
individual characteristics as personal ornaments to
obtain a place in the portrait. In the canons for
painters laid down by C. A. Du Fresnoy of Paris,
entitled <i>De arte graphica</i>, which ruled artists of the
first half of the eighteenth century, it was particularly
enjoined that "portraits should not be overladen with
gold and jewels." "The portrait painters," as Reynolds
expressed it in speaking of his predecessors as far back
as Lely and Kneller, "had a set of postures (and ornaments
too) which they applied to all persons indiscriminately."</p>

<p>Seeing the reliance that may be placed on the jewellery
figured in the portraits of earlier times, it is not unnatural
to expect such detail to be of considerable
service in art criticism. In the identification of a portrait
much may rest on the identification of its jewels:
for "a portrait," as Mr. Andrew Lang says, "with the
jewels actually owned by the subject, if not 'the rose'
(for it may be a copy of a lost original) has certainly
been 'near the rose.'" But critics seldom think of examining
the numerous extant royal and noble inventories
and other documents such as wills containing lists
of jewels, and of comparing the jewels described in them
with those displayed in portraits.</p>

<p>This method, neglected as a rule in criticism, has
been employed by Mr. Lang with conspicuous success
in his <i>Portraits and jewels of Mary Stuart</i>, and has
served to identify the remarkable portrait of the Scottish

Interesting as it is when the jewels depicted in the
portraits are identical with those described in their
owners' inventories, it is even more so when the actual
jewels thus represented have survived to the present
day, such as is the case with the Penruddock Jewel
shown in Lucas de Heere's portrait of Sir George Penruddock;
the Drake Jewel in Zucchero's portrait of Sir

<p class="center"><b>FRAUDS AND FORGERIES</b></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>WING to the important position that jewellery
occupies in the domain of virtu, it is natural
that it should receive particular attention at the
hands of the fraudulent. On the question of frauds of
jewellery we have to distinguish between forgeries&mdash;articles
professing to be genuine ancient works of art&mdash;and
counterfeits&mdash;imitations of real objects. Long
before the forger, as we define him, set to work on the
field of jewellery, there existed the business of the
imitator of precious stones and precious metals&mdash;one of
counterfeit rather than of forgery.</p>

<p>The production of false gems dates from the time
that precious stones first came to be generally worn as
personal ornaments. The manufacture of imitations,
intended in many cases to pass as real stones, was an
important branch of the art of the famous glassworkers
of antiquity. These glass gems, or pastes as they are
termed, were largely set in rings to meet the tastes of
the poorer classes; and are referred to by Pliny as the
"glass gems from the rings of the multitude." Would-be
smart individuals, also, are frequently satirised by
Martial for wearing in their rings glass pastes which
they attempted to pass off as real stones. At the same
time coloured foils were placed as the backing to transparent
stones, and were employed to give a full hue to
inferior-coloured stones.</p>

<p>Besides being employed for jewellery, precious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_356" id="page_356">{356}</a></span>stones were made use of by the medi&aelig;val embroiderers to
increase the effect of the coloured materials and gold
thread in the decoration of their robes. But when we
bear in mind the accurate descriptions given by Theophilus
in his <i>Diversarum Artium Schedula</i> of the
process of making false gems, it is only reasonable to
assume that many of the so-called jewels were not in
fact real gems, but imitations. Certain it is that in
medi&aelig;val times the counterfeiting of precious stones
was very largely carried on, while many accounts are
preserved in early records of fines and other punishments
inflicted on dishonest traders in gems who attempted
to dispose of spurious stones, usually set in
finger rings. In England and France during the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries it was customary for the
jewellers' guild of each town to have a rule prohibiting
its members from setting paste gems in real gold or real
gems in plated metal; from mounting Scottish pearls
with those of the East; or mingling coloured glass, or
false, with precious stones. As in earlier periods, a
crystal or a colourless paste was made to imitate a
coloured stone by backing it with a foil. At South
Kensington an example exists, set in a gold ring of
sixteenth-century German work (No. 1206-'03), of a
white crystal, which is cut <i>en cabochon</i> and backed with
a red foil, and bears a striking resemblance to a carbuncle
(Pl. XXIII, 17).</p>

<p>Many books on precious stones, both old and new,
give receipts for the manufacture of imitation gems,
made of flint glass and coloured with oxides according
to the originals they are intended to counterfeit. Apart
from these are false gems produced with really fraudulent
intent. Since imitation stones cannot resist the
file, it is the practice, besides backing a crystal with
coloured foil, to back a thin layer of genuine stone&mdash;intended
to resist the test when examined for hardness&mdash;with
a layer of glass coloured as required. Another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_357" id="page_357">{357}</a></span>process of fabrication consists of placing a layer of
glass between two layers of true stone. The place of
the join in the "triplet" is hidden by the collet of the
setting, and the deceit can only be detected by unsetting
the stone and soaking it in chloroform. Another means
employed for changing and improving the colours of
stones is by heat, for the colour of nearly all gems is
affected by heating.</p>

<p>Not pastes only but clear crystals have long been
palmed off on the unwary for diamonds. Perhaps
the best-known of these were crystals of quartz found
in the Clifton limestone near Bristol, which went by
the name of Bristol diamonds. They are alluded to
as worn in the ears by the fop described in Lenton's
<i>Young Gallant's Whirligigg</i> (1629). Quartz crystals
found in the tin mines of Cornwall, and similar stones
from the neighbourhood of Harrogate, still known
respectively as Cornish and Harrogate diamonds, were
also much employed for jewellery from the sixteenth
century. Transparent stones from various parts of
the Continent are given the names of the localities
in which they are found. In France, rock crystal, cut
in rose or brilliant form, went generally by the name
of <i>Pierre d' Alen&ccedil;on</i> or <i>Caillou du Rhin</i>.</p>

<p>Of the transparent glass paste termed Stras or
Strass we have already spoken. Though an imitation,
the paste of eighteenth-century jewellery does
not necessarily belong to the category of frauds and
counterfeits, since it possesses a certain originality of
its own, and does not appear to have been generally
worn with intent to deceive. False or mock pearls
on the other hand seem in some way to be rather
more associated with deception, though they also can
be made to serve for decorative purposes entirely
apart from any such intent. To reproduce the lustre
or "orient" characteristic of oriental pearls, use is
made in the fabrication of imitations of a pearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_358" id="page_358">{358}</a></span>essence known as <i>essence d'orient</i>, obtained from the
silvery scales on the underside of a fish called the
bleak. Beads of blown glass slightly opalescent and
treated with acid to produce an iridescent surface are
coated internally with a film of the essence, and wax
is then introduced to give the bead the desired weight.
Other mock pearls are made up of a vitreous composition
formed largely of the pearl essence. Their surface
when burnished presents a fine lustre. These
are generally termed Venetian pearls. Roman pearls
are formed of external coatings produced by frequent
dippings into a solution made of the pearliest parts
of the oyster.</p>

<p>From earliest times frauds have been committed
in connection with the precious metals. The goldsmiths
and jewellers of the Middle Ages were forbidden
to work in base metal, to use false stones of
glass, or to put coloured foil beneath real stones.
They were further expressly forbidden to manufacture
personal ornaments for secular use of gilt or
silvered copper or brass. Documents in the archives
of the City of London contain many references to the
perpetration of fraud in passing off as real, objects
of brass or latten that had been silvered or gilded.
In 1369 a conviction and punishment by the pillory
took place for selling to "divers persons rings and
fermails of latten, of coloured gold and silver, as
being made of real gold and silver, in deceit, and to
the grievous loss, of the common people"; and in
1376 a workman was imprisoned for having silvered
240 buttons of latten, and thirty-four latten rims for
gipci&egrave;res, and having "maliciously purposed and
imagined to sell the same for pure silver, in deceit
of the people." From actual objects that have survived
it would seem that the more heinous offence was
not infrequently committed of plating with silver the
baser metals of tin, lead, and pewter. The statutes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_359" id="page_359">{359}</a></span>of the goldsmiths ordained that no jeweller should
sell any article of silver unless it was as fine as sterling,
"nor sett it to sell before it be touched" with the
leopard's head and maker's mark. But exceptions
were always made in favour of small articles of
jewellery "which could not reasonably bear the same
touch." Such materials as <i>pinchbeck</i> and <i>Similor</i> and
the plated objects of modern times hardly fall within
the present category.</p>

<p>Actual forgeries of personal ornaments can scarcely
be said to have been committed until comparatively
recent years&mdash;not, in fact, until the demand for specimens
of old jewellery on the part of the antiquary and
connoisseur rendered their reproduction profitable.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the high prices they command from
collectors, or to various facilities afforded for their production
and disposal, three classes of objects&mdash;Greek
and Etruscan jewellery, medi&aelig;val rings, and enamelled
pendants of the Renaissance&mdash;offer the strongest temptation
to the forger; and he on his part displays such
an amount of skill and ingenuity, that the fabrication
of spurious antiquities of this kind may be said to have
amounted almost to a fine art.</p>

<p>The much sought after gold jewellery of Greece and
Etruria has received more attention than any other,
partly on account of the fact that gold is subject to but
slight oxidisation; for the patina of age is lacking even
on ancient examples. Setting aside the beautiful
imitations by such artists as Castellani, father and
sons, and later by Melillo and Giuliano&mdash;which clever
reproductions are known to have been sometimes
foisted upon collectors by unscrupulous dealers&mdash;a
great deal of really false work made with the intent
of passing for old has been produced in Italy&mdash;chiefly
at Rome, Naples, and Florence. On the subject of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_360" id="page_360">{360}</a></span>such pseudo-antiques Count Tyszkiewicz has several
good stories to tell in his <i>Memories of an Old Collector</i>.
Of all objects of this kind, that which has claimed the
largest share of public attention is the notorious "Tiara
of Saitapharnes," which deceived several well-known
authorities, and reposed for several years as a genuine
antique in the Louvre, until the revelation in 1903
of the person of its ingenious author&mdash;a Russian Jew
of Odessa.</p>

<p>The disclosure of this remarkable fraud was the
climax of a long series of forgeries of ancient Greek
jewellery from Southern Russia, which, purporting to
be recovered from the Greek tombs of Olbia and
Kertch, long renowned for their wealth in such objects,
were purchased by more than one well-known collector.
So keenly has the forger pursued his evil course in this
particular domain, that, apart from that preserved in
museums and in the cabinets of collectors whose personal
judgment is sound on such matters, M. Eudel
goes so far as to say that the greater portion of the
antique jewellery extant is of recent fabrication.</p>

<p>Medi&aelig;val ornaments of all sorts are forged at the
present day upon the Continent to a considerable
extent, though less than are those of later times.
One important centre of their production is Paris.
Another, in earlier years in particular, was Frankfort,
where visitors to watering-places on the Rhine
have long been the victims of fraudulent vendors.
Such medi&aelig;val objects, however well supported by a
dealer's warranty of place and time of discovery,
require, says Mr. King, to be examined by the amateur
with a very suspicious and critical eye. Among other
personal ornaments of this period that have received
attention at the hands of the forger are the leaden
badges known as pilgrims' signs. Many ingenious
forgeries of the kind were produced about forty-five
years ago, and purported to be brought to light by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_361" id="page_361">{361}</a></span>workmen engaged in excavations near the Thames in
the City of London. These were in large part the
work of two illiterate mud-rakers on the banks of the
river; while articles of like kind were shortly afterwards
made by two men known as "Billy and Charley," who
manufactured a number of curious pendent medals of
lead and "cock-metal."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The discovery in the Seine,
about the same time, of many genuine pilgrims' signs
led to the circulation also in France of a quantity of
spurious objects of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Renaissance pendants, the prizes of the connoisseur,
are favourite subjects for reproduction at the present
day, for, unlike the earlier objects, they are not ill-adapted
for personal use. Jewellery in the Cinquecento
style has for several years past been made in large
quantities at Vienna. These jewels are generally not
in gold, like the works they profess to imitate, but in
silver-gilt, and as a result their enamel is never of fine
quality, their general appearance is not up to the
standard of the old, and their workmanship is mostly
very mechanical. Apart from these and similar works,
made also in France and generally sold in jewellers'
shops as modern productions, there are others which
pretend to age. Though one seldom meets with
examples that approach the best productions of the
Renaissance, objects of the kind are occasionally
imitated with such proficiency, that in collecting specimens
of early jewellery in no instances is it necessary
to exercise greater caution than in those of the Cinquecento.</p>

<p>Fine jewellery of the eighteenth century, now almost
equally sought after&mdash;watches, chatelaines, rings, and
brooches&mdash;has been multiplied in quantities during
recent years. As the brooches of this date are very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_362" id="page_362">{362}</a></span>often mounted with rose-cut diamonds, care has been
taken to employ stones cut in this manner. Their
settings generally distinguish the copies. Again, as
M. Eudel points out, when fine old diamond-work
has been sent to be reset, the jeweller preserves the
old mounts, sets them with modern stones or pastes,
and sells them as genuine old work. For the purpose
of furthering the deception complete parures purporting
to be seventeenth or eighteenth century work
are offered for sale in genuine old leather or shagreen
cases. A set of jewels may even be made for the
special purpose of fitting such a case, or an entirely
new case constructed, and treated in such a manner
as to give it an appearance of age.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEMENTO MORI</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 16em;">
                  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">"I will keep it,</span><br />
As they keep deaths' heads in rings,<br />
To cry <i>memento</i> to me."</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE study of the various forms of personal ornament
by means of which the memory of the
dead or of death itself has been preserved by
the living is one which offers a wide field for investigation.
The Egyptians enforced the precept "<i>Memento
Mori</i>" by introducing at their banquets a small coffin
containing the image of a corpse which, according to
Herodotus, was shown to each guest. In classical
times skeletons were rarely represented, though one is
sculptured on a tomb at Pompeii.</p>

<p>The warning "<i>Memento Mori</i>" manifested itself in
divers fashions in the Middle Ages, the most conspicuous
being the famous "Dance of Death," which
made its d&eacute;but in the fourteenth century, and was
figured by Holbein in the sixteenth. Testimony of
the desire of all to keep the warning constantly
before the mind is borne by personal ornaments of
various kinds displaying emblems of mortality. In
order to arrive at the meaning of these crude emblems
so often applied to objects of jewellery, regard should be
paid to the feelings of the times that gave them birth.</p>

<p>During the latter period of the Middle Ages the
grim and ascetic contemplation of death caused the
artists of that period to represent it as the devil,
the father of sin, horned and cloven-hoofed, carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_364" id="page_364">{364}</a></span>off the sinful souls and forcing them into the mouth
of hell. But when during the fifteenth century "printing
excited men's imaginations, when the first discovery
of the ancient classics roused their emulation and
stimulated their unrest, when the Renaissance in art
increased their eagerness to express their thoughts and
multiplied their method of expression,"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and their
conscience was turned to the latter end and the unseen
world, then at length did death appear, no longer as
the father of sin, but altered into a familiar and human
personification.</p>

<p>Side by side with the strange vigour and extraordinary
joy in life that marked the period, there existed a
great contempt for the value of life and a gross familiarity
with death. It was Death himself, according to
the imagination of the sixteenth century, who, always
at hand, clutched men of every age and condition by
the sleeve and hurried them all unwillingly away.</p>

<p>The emblems of death were always presented in
close touch with the living. The forms they took&mdash;the
skeleton, or simply the skull, or Death's head, with
cross-bones&mdash;were rendered in the sixteenth century by
both painter and sculptor; but it was reserved for the
goldsmith&mdash;the sculptor and painter in one&mdash;to represent
them on jewellery through the medium of the precious
metals enriched with gems and coloured enamels. They
figured on every kind of ornament. Brooches with
enamelled skulls were fastened as enseignes upon the
hat; golden jewels like funereal objects in shape of
coffins holding enamelled skeletons hung from the neck;
rosary beads, pomanders and watches in the form of
human skulls were attached to the waist; and rings
bearing Death's heads and other emblems were worn
upon the fingers.</p>

<p>A great impetus was given to the use of such articles
of adornment by Diana of Poitiers when she became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_365" id="page_365">{365}</a></span>mistress of Henry II of France. She was then a widow
in mourning; and the complaisant Court not only
adopted her black and white as the fashionable colour,
but covered their personal ornaments with emblems of
death.</p>

<p>Jewels of this description, it is clear, were not
necessarily carried in remembrance of any special individual.
With their legend "Memento Mori" they were
simply reminders of Death in the abstract. As such
they characterised exactly the temper of the time, and
were quite commonly worn by the upper and middle
classes, especially by those who affected a respectable
gravity. At the time of which we now speak the
personal badge or <i>devise</i>, an obscure expression of
some particular conceit of its wearer, was at the
height of fashion. In its elaboration the various emblems
of death were largely put under contribution,
their choice for the purpose being the outcome of the
special disposition of those who adopted them. Perhaps
the most notable instance of the representation of a
badge of this kind is in Holbein's famous "Ambassadors,"
in the National Gallery. Here Jean de Dinteville,
who stands on the left of the picture, wears a
circular jewel formed of a white enamelled skull in a
gold mount, pinned as an enseigne to the lower rim of
his small black bonnet.</p>

<p>Amongst sundry ornaments bearing mortuary devices,
there is a good example at South Kensington&mdash;a
<i>Memento Mori</i> charm of enamelled gold in the form of
a coffin containing a minutely articulated skeleton. It
is English work of the Elizabethan period, and was
found at Tor Abbey, Devonshire (Pl. XLIV, 16).</p>

<p>No article of decoration has been more extensively
used as a "Memento Mori" or for memorial purposes
than the finger ring. The association of the ring is
largely with affairs of the heart, and lovers are united
with it. And since the form itself is emblematic of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_366" id="page_366">{366}</a></span>eternity, so by this same token of affection has the
memory of departed friends been kept green.</p>

<p>The sepulchral emblems referred to were not made
use of for medi&aelig;val ornaments. But in the sixteenth
century they were very frequent, especially on rings.
One of the most remarkable specimens of the wonderful
mastery over technical difficulties which stamps the
goldsmith's work of this time is a "Memento Mori"
ring of German work in the Waddesdon Bequest. Its
bezel or top is in the form of a book, decorated at each
corner with a diamond, emerald, sapphire, and ruby,
with snakes and toads between them. In the centre is
a death's head. The lid on opening discloses a recumbent
figure with skull and hour-glass. On the shoulders
of the ring, supporting the bezel, are figures of
Adam and Eve representing The Fall and Expulsion
from Eden. All the figures are enamelled in high
relief, and though merely a fraction of an inch in size,
are executed with extraordinary fidelity. A ring described
as having belonged to Mary Stuart is in the
possession of the Earl of Ilchester. Its bezel, composed
of a large ruby cut in the form of a death's head
and set with diamond eyes, is supported underneath by
cross-bones in enamel. Woeiriot's beautiful collection
of designs for rings, of the year 1561, contains a ring
of this kind surmounted with a skull and cross-bones;
and Gilles L&eacute;gar&eacute;'s <i>Recueil</i> of a century later has an
engraving of similar pattern (Pl. XL).</p>

<p>English rings of the sixteenth century have a death's
head carved in intaglio on carnelian, or sunk in the metal
of the ring and sometimes filled with enamel. Around
is the motto "Memento Mori," and similar expressions
in Latin or in English (Pl. XXXVI, 12). A certain
Agnes Hals whose will is dated 1554 bequeathed to her
niece "my rynge of gold with the wepinge eie," and to
her son "my rynge with the dead manes head."</p>

<p>From the commencement of the seventeenth century
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_367" id="page_367">{367}</a></span>Memento Mori rings begin to be worn also as memorials
of the departed, and bequests of money were frequently
made for their purchase. The decoration of many of
the rings of this period is very curious. On some the
death's head in its natural shape is beautifully formed
in enamel, has small diamond eyes, and is supported on
each side by skeletons bent along the hoop of the ring.
The bezel of others is of crystal in the shape of a coffin,
the lid of which on being removed discloses a skeleton.
Widows on the death of their husbands sometimes
converted their wedding rings into memorial rings.
This was done by engraving outside an elongated skeleton,
the bones of which were brought into prominence
by a background of black enamel.</p>

<p>Inside the memorial rings of the time was often a
motto or posy, appropriate for the purpose, sometimes
rhyming:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
          Prepared be<br />
          To follow me;</div></div></div>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">or</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
I restless live, yet hope to see<br />
That day of Christ, and then see thee.</div></div></div>

<p>Rings of this kind, commonly known as mourning
rings, were frequently given, together with gloves and
hat-bands, to those who attended at funerals. They
were inscribed, in addition to a posy, with the initials
of the deceased and the date. Evelyn at his son's
funeral in 1658 distributed a number of rings with the
motto "Dominus abstulit." At Pepys' funeral upwards
of a hundred and thirty rings were given to
friends and relatives.</p>

<p>Mention must be made, amongst other memorial
jewellery, of the various objects worn in memory of
Charles I. Most of these are finger rings containing a
portrait of the ill-fated monarch, which were made and
worn by Royalists after his execution. Some are so
contrived that the portrait can only be discovered by
opening a lid formed of a table diamond. They were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_368" id="page_368">{368}</a></span>doubtless used by those for whom devotion of the kind
was dangerous. Other jewels worn in memory of the
Royal Martyr were heart-shaped lockets, inscribed and
decorated in a suitably funereal manner with skulls,
cross-bones, and like emblems.</p>

<p>An important group of ornaments, dating from the
time of Charles II to that of Queen Anne, are those in
the form of small memorial brooches, lockets, bracelet
clasps, buttons, and slides with loops at the back for
attachment to a velvet band. They are of considerable
interest in that they represent almost the only surviving
examples of English jewellery of the time. The Franks
Bequest in the British Museum contains several specimens.
They usually have letters in a fine filigree of
gold entwined in a monogram, laid on a ground of
crimson silk, and covered with a thick crystal set in
gold. The gold filigree, which is of extraordinary
delicacy, is often laid on braids of hair arranged in
various designs, and accompanied by the skull and
cross-bones. The crystal covering is sometimes cut in
table form, but is more often rose-cut. The locket
surrounded with pearls shown on Plate XLIV has on
its surface no less than a hundred facets.</p>

<p>Memorial rings of the same period have bezels with
similar designs beneath a rose diamond or faceted
crystal. Their hoops are mostly enamelled black on
the shoulders. In the second quarter of the eighteenth
century the mortuary emblems of skull and cross-bones
in general disappear. The hoop of the ring is shaped
in the form of a scroll or ribbon, and set with a small
diamond, a coloured stone, or usually a white crystal.
Around the hoop is inscribed in enamel the name and
age of the deceased, and date of death. Black enamel
was used for those who had been married; while white
was employed for the unmarried&mdash;just as it was the
practice at the funeral of an unmarried man or woman
for the mourners and attendants to be clothed in white.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page_369" id="page_369">{369}</a></span></p><p>Mourning jewellery was extremely popular in
England towards the end of the eighteenth and in
the early part of the nineteenth century. The variety
of design in objects of the kind then in use, and the
ingenuity displayed in their production, may well be
judged from a collection numbering upwards of one
hundred and fifty specimens in the Victoria and Albert
Museum.</p>

<p>Some mementoes of the deceased are simply miniature
portraits, as well as cameos and silhouettes, the
miniature sometimes taking the form of a single eye
set round with pearls or diamonds. But in most cases
it appears to have been the custom to wear in lockets,
brooches, and rings microscopic devices&mdash;works of infinite
patience and skill&mdash;wrought in hair, with initials and
other designs cunningly worked in seed pearls. There
were also, sometimes, paintings in <i>grisaille</i>
(Pl. XLVII, 2, 3). These often represented a lady in mourning
garb weeping over a funeral urn, in the style of the ornament
worn by Mr. Wemmick, the attorney's clerk in <i>Great
Expectations</i>, of whom Dickens gives the following
inimitable description: "I judged him to be a bachelor
from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements; for he
wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch
representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb
with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings
and seals hung at his watch chain, as if he were quite
laden with remembrances of departed friends." Further
on Mr. Wemmick himself describes his personal jewellery,
and concludes by remarking: "I always take
'em. They're curiosities. And they're property. They
may not be worth much, but, after all, they're property
and portable.... My guiding-star always is, Get hold
of portable property."</p>

<p>The painted brooches backed with hair and set
round with pearls form, as a matter of fact, very pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_370" id="page_370">{370}</a></span>jewels, in spite of the sombreness of their subject and
the trivial sentimentality of their mottoes, which run
in this vein: "Whose hair I wear&#8212;-I loved most dear."</p>

<p>Mourning jewellery was usually set with pearls,
garnets, or more often jet. The last, until a short
while ago, was in universal favour, and was fashioned
into all sorts of ornaments. It fortunately now
meets with but little demand. The same applies
to hair jewellery, of human hair woven in many intricate
plaitings into brooches, rings, bracelets, and
chains. The brooches of about the "forties" have a
broad border inscribed with the word "Memory," etc.,
in Gothic letters on black enamel, and in the centre a
panel of plaited hair. The custom of wearing ornaments
composed of such sombre and unpleasing
material has now to all intents and purposes ceased,
though it is carried on to a certain extent in France,
where <i>ouvrages en cheveux</i> in the form of bracelets and
lockets are still worn as <i>pr&eacute;cieux souvenirs de famille</i>.</p>

<p>After the middle of the nineteenth century the
use of mourning rings and other memorial jewellery
began to die out. The goddess Fashion, who throughout
all ages has waged war on the productions of
the goldsmith, has laid a heavier hand on these than
on any other forms of personal ornament&mdash;a circumstance
which accounts for the survival at the present
day of a comparatively small proportion of the
enormous quantity of objects of this description that
must formerly have been produced. Most families
from time to time have consigned to the melting-pot
accumulations of these memorials of their predecessors;
and those who have been long in the jeweller's business
confess to the hundreds of such relics that they have broken

Some estimate of their magnificence and extent may be
obtained by means of contemporary inventories. The most remarkable
inventory is perhaps that of John&#8217;s eldest son, Charles
V&mdash;&ldquo;the Wise&rdquo;&mdash;drawn up in 1379 and published
by J. Labarte. Scarcely less remarkable are the jewel inventories
of his three other sons, Louis Duke of Anjou, John Duke of Berry,
and Philip (le Hardi) Duke of Burgundy, which have been published
respectively by L. de Laborde, J. Guiffrey, and B. Prost.</p></div>

Several inventories of the contents of the Burgundian
treasury have been preserved. Lists of the magnificent jewels of two
of the most powerful and wealthy, those of Philip the Good (1396-1467)
and his son Charles the Bold (1433-1477) have been published by
Laborde in his <i>Ducs de Bourgogne</i>, Pt. 2, Vol. II.</p></div>

<p>Treatises on precious stones frequently find a place in
sixteenth-century Herbals, and are often accompanied by very
spirited woodcuts representing the working of precious stones
and the process of adapting them to personal ornaments,
together with designs of actual articles of jewellery in which
they are set. Two of the finest books of the kind are&mdash;an
<i>Ortus Sanitatis</i> (Strasburg, <i>circa</i> 1497), and a
<i>Kreuterbuch</i> printed at Frankfort in 1536.</p></div>

Several writers on Pilgrims&#8217; Signs state that a furnace
destined for the same purpose may still be seen in an upper chamber
in Canterbury Cathedral. Inquiry on the spot has failed to confirm
the truth of this statement. The furnace in question has been used
solely for the purpose of casting leadwork for repairing the roof.
The badges were probably made somewhere in the Cathedral precints.</p></div>

The word <i>bar</i> (corresponding to the French <i>clou</i>) was

daughters of Zion (Isa. <span class="smcap">iii.</span> 18), was

This tendency is as common as ever in the East, particularly
among high-class natives of India, on account of the prevailing
belief that the only safe way to invest money is to purchase
precious stones and similar articles of intrinsic or sterling

&ldquo;The origin of money from ornament.&rdquo;)</p></div>
